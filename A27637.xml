         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>I Have very ≈øadly ob≈øerved the great di≈øtre≈øs of Humane Affairs, through mi≈øcarriages e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way in point of Religion.</p>
            <p>For while the Powers of this world and Eccle≈øia≈øtick Juri≈ødictions take it for their Right, to impo≈øe by ≈øevere Penalties, and dreadful Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures, what they think fit under ≈øo great a name; they yet neither can a≈ø≈øure any one, they are not, or do not u≈øe to be mi≈øtaken in their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; or that all their Authority or Power ≈øhall excu≈øe and acquit tho≈øe that obey them, when they appear before <hi>Gods Tribunal;</hi> ≈øo that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible the Judgment or Con≈øcience ≈øhould have any repo≈øe here.</p>
            <p>On the other ≈øide, ≈øome not only out of Recoyl for ≈øelf-pre≈øervation, or out of de≈øign, but from Furious Wild Principles, have broken out into publick di≈øturbance, to make room for what they have proclaim'd, as the Kingdom of God and Chri≈øt, to the great ≈øcandal of True Religion, the imbrewing their hands very horridly in Blood, and the ≈øeeming Ju≈øtification of utmo≈øt Rigors, again≈øt
<pb facs="tcp:65165:3"/> any pretences of Religion, except according to Law.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides all this, private Feuds and Animo≈øities, vehement and angry di≈øputes, are every where cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, and people hereupon in great Amu≈øe, what they ≈øhould believe or do.</p>
            <p>Now ≈øince there is no doubt, all the≈øe evils are fore≈øeen by God; there is as little doubt, that there are ≈øure Remedies provided again≈øt them.</p>
            <p>I have then upon the whole this account to give the Reader.</p>
            <p>That the ob≈øervation of ≈øo many Counter-Cries of Opinion, ≈øuch great Exa≈øperations in mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ≈øuch Complaints of oppre≈ø≈øion of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by undue Laws, ≈øuch Recriminations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Sedition, Fanatici≈øm, not only among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians, but among Prote≈øtant Chri≈øtians, and of the ≈øame Common National Intere≈øt, mov'd me to ≈øeek Retirement to ≈øome <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Certainty,</hi> that I might be at <hi>perfect Peace upon,</hi> in full ≈øatisfaction of Judgment and compo≈øure of Affection: and having found <hi>Natural Religion</hi> as certain as our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental Chri≈øtianity,</hi> in mo≈øt things of the ≈øame immediate certainty as Natural; in all things after due exploration, of the ≈øame final cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, I am ≈øo far at Peace in my Judgment, as to have no doubt <hi>WHAT IS TR<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>TH</hi> in relation to Eternal Happine≈øs, if <hi>ten thou≈øand more of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65165:3"/> encompa≈ø≈øed me round about; ≈øo far at Peace in my Affections, as not to be in Commotion with any man that gives Te≈øtimony to Chri≈øtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he is a ≈øtrict ob≈øerver of Natural Religion, and Fundamental Chri≈øtianity; one E≈ø≈øential Rule of both which is, <hi>Love, Peace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to all that are centred in this Natural Chri≈øtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they may adjoyn or refu≈øe ≈øome Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick <hi>Placits</hi> that do not harm the Foundation.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, I am a≈ø≈øur'd this very Natural Religion e≈øpou≈øed by Chri≈øtianity, well con≈øidered and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved, would di≈øarm the world of tho≈øe In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cruelty in the Cau≈øe of Religion, ≈øo extreamly abhored by it; whether u≈øed by angry ≈øupreme Powers, or unju≈øtly taken up by Seditious, Ambitious or Fanatick Subjects. Which Cruelty men are ≈øain to borrow from wild Bea≈øts, no ≈øuch being given by the Gracious Author of all things to ≈øo excellent a Nature as he made the <hi>Humane,</hi> and therefore mo≈øt certainly not by the Redeemer, nor his Religion, who came to fill the world with Innocency, Goodne≈øs and Peace, after ≈øo great an Inva≈øion of Barbarity and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Now having found this ≈øatisfaction my ≈øelf, I make offer of it, if it may be the ≈øame to others, asking only Candid Interpretation in particular management, the main Principle being above the need of pardon or the Fear of Indignation.</p>

                     <p>The Fir≈øt mo≈øt excellent and ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary ≈øervice and wor≈øhip of God, is the pre≈øenting him a holy, pure, and intelligent Spirit, in a mo≈øt lowly adoration of, and a≈øtoni≈øhment at his incomprehen≈øible Perfections; in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, fear, and mo≈øt intent love of him, in a ready obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientialne≈øs to all his commands and coun≈øels, in a ≈øtedfa≈øt tru≈øt and reliance upon his Divine a≈ø≈øi≈øtances, infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Bounty, and expectation of his gracious Recompences, in humble≈øt a≈øpirings to his likene≈øs, and the fruition of him for ever: and all this with a continual eye at his Glory, and

                     <p>Next to this fundamental and mo≈øt real wor≈øhip of God, is that external wor≈øhip, which from the ≈øame Rea≈øons of Gods being infinite Under≈øtanding, Spirit and Truth, mu≈øt be al≈øo mo≈øt Intellectual, and ≈øpiritual in the Soul, guiding tho≈øe Organs of the Body mo≈øt prepared to rational u≈øe, but with the mo≈øt plain, ≈øimple and unaffected attendance and compliance of ge≈øtures, according to the cu≈øtom of Countries, as ≈øtanding, kneeling, bowing, uncovering the head, and ≈øuch-like decencies of habit and behaviour; and the≈øe only as following and waiting upon Rational Service, which is all that Natural Religion requires of outward Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>This wor≈øhip of God then in the Di≈øcour≈øes of Wi≈ødom, and Holy Rea≈øon concerning him, ari≈øing from deep Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Contemplation of him, Di≈øcour≈øes of Obedience to him, and Conformity with his Excellent Attributes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of eternal injoyment of him; Declaration of his Works of Creation and Providence; of his final judgments; of that chief of his ≈øublunary Works, Humane Nature; Ob≈øervation of the Degeneracy of man by ≈øin, the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes of the po≈ø≈øible Recovery and Re≈øtoration of man by Repentance, of the infinite patience of God, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈øs to pardon, as a ≈øtrong Incentive to Repentance.</p>

                     <p>I come in the next place to con≈øider how far time, place, di≈øtinction of per≈øons in religious wor≈øhip, are within the cogni≈øance of the law and light of Nature.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65165:15"/> of Primitive rules concerning time; and I find but two things I can ≈øuppo≈øe injunctions of ≈øo ancient a date pertaining to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the time be ≈øufficient, capacious enough for the receipt of Religious duty and action, ≈øufficient for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ample inquiries and ≈øearches into Divine things; for the ≈øouls commoration, and re≈øt upon them for the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Religious bu≈øine≈øs and duty; and ≈øo ≈øuitable and agreeable to the te≈øtification of our honour to the ≈øupreme Maje≈øty, by offering ≈øuch a proportion of our time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øuch frequency of returns, with the <hi>favour of ≈øea≈øon,</hi> and <hi>redeeming ≈øea≈øon,</hi> when it ≈øeems to fly from us; that in all we may have a liberal ≈øpace for ≈øo grand a bu≈øine≈øs in our more ≈øtated and occa≈øional performances.</p>

El≈øe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive it could be defin'd by the laws of natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding. For <hi>place,</hi> the≈øe two things are al≈øo nece≈ø≈øary.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>places</hi> be as agreeable as may be to the end; ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and retired places for retired and ≈øecret wor≈øhip; places
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65165:15"/> of dome≈øtick coveniency for Families; and publick, known, and agreed, for publick wor≈øhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That places for Divine Wor≈øhip have the decency, gravity and ≈øolemnity that is ≈øuitable to ≈øuch a degree and quality of bu≈øine≈øs as is there to be negotiated; not as any part of Divine Wor≈øhip, or ≈øo much as having any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential conducivene≈øs upon the mind in ≈øuch action, but ≈øolely as the re≈øult of humane prudence adju≈øting every thing to its proper u≈øe and ≈øervice, and with the <hi>decorum</hi> mo≈øt natural to it.</p>
                     <p>For time and place having no influence upon Religious actions, more than upon all common humane actions by any peculiar vertue of their own, they cannot without a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Sanctification from God, with which he by his revealed will acquaints tho≈øe upon whom he is plea≈øed to enjoin the ob≈øervation, ri≈øe any higher than them≈øelves. Nor can hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appointment extend them beyond expediency and decency; the ordinary rules by which all things civil and humane are ≈øquar'd.</p>
                     <p>Devotion can mount nothing higher than its own true elevation as to the nature of the thing. Devotion (I ≈øay) and zeal a≈øcend up to God, yet they leave the things they u≈øe behind to re≈øt in their own ≈øtation.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65165:16"/> injurious thoughts of God, as if <hi>he dwelt in Temples made with hands,</hi> and the pre≈øence of the <hi>Lord of Heaven and Earth</hi> confin'd there; whereas except by his own choice upon certain rea≈øons, as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> all places are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and He equally accepts tho≈øe that wor≈øhip him <hi>in ≈øpirit and truth.</hi> He that inhabits Ubiquity, is no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 21, 23, 24.</note> or di≈ødains mean and unadorn'd places for his ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than ≈øtately Structures.

Yet doth God allow to men the wi≈øe and prudent choice of their own conveniences in his wor≈øhip, both for time or place, not pre≈øuming to ≈øanctifie any thing to him, that he hath not fir≈øt ≈øanctified to him≈øelf; for who knows how to chu≈øe for him? or <hi>who is able to give to him fir≈øt?</hi> This mu≈øt needs be the determination of natural rea≈øon, if it u≈øe its own light, and di≈øcharge its own tru≈øt.</p>
                     <p>Having ≈øpoken thus briefly of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> I come to the third thing, <hi>Di≈øtinction or ≈øeparation of per≈øons for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine offices;</hi> how far it is directed by natural Religion, under the≈øe three Heads.</p>

                     <p>For there are but three ways whereby per≈øons can be ≈øuppo≈øed authorized to pre≈øidency in Divine Things.</p>

                     <p>This Exhortation of the Apo≈øtle contains two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Duty the Apo≈øtle enjoins, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>making of prayers, ≈øupplications, interce≈ø≈øions,</hi> and not them only, but <hi>giving of thanks,</hi> and <hi>for all men,</hi> and not only but <hi>eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> for <hi>Kings and all that are in authority.</hi> Now in that the Apo≈øtle injoins <hi>giving of thanks,</hi> it argues, though he did not exclude, yet he did not intend the only matter of the prayers ≈øhould be the conver≈øion of tho≈øe prayed for. For there being then no conver≈øion of Princes, nor ≈øo general conver≈øion of private per≈øons as ≈øhould be <hi>expre≈ø≈øed by all men,</hi> there could be no matter for <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> But that which was mainly in the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> eye, was, that <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> ≈øhould concern them≈øelves in all the <hi>happine≈øs</hi> and <hi>welfare of mankind,</hi> both by <hi>Supplications, Prayers, and Interce≈ø≈øions;</hi> that is, with all the earne≈øtne≈øs, and heartine≈øs ≈øignified in that accumulation of expre≈ø≈øions, and al≈øo by <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> for the mercies they enjoyed; and in <hi>eminent manner</hi> for Kings and tho≈øe in <hi>eminency,</hi> who are the <hi>Tru≈øtees</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitaries</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Pro≈øperity</hi> of the world; and by this means <hi>Chri≈øtian Religion</hi> ≈øhould be known to be mo≈øt agreeable with the true <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>excellent Religion</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> and a fair <hi>Rational Inducement</hi> offered to embrace it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The advantage the Apo≈øtle expre≈ø≈øes as ari≈øing from the due performance of this duty; That men in general
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65165:28"/> and Princes in ≈øpecial, being convinced of their rights by the evidence of tho≈øe two main parts of <hi>Natural Religion, Piety towards God, Love of Humane nature,</hi> and the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>From hence then I ob≈øerve, the main foundation of right to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quietne≈øs,</hi> is <hi>Godline≈øs</hi> and <hi>Honourablene≈øs</hi> of <hi>manners,</hi> in oppo≈øition to all <hi>Immorality:</hi> And <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> for all men and Princes are mo≈øt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be under≈øtood for the <hi>Tranquibity,</hi> and <hi>flouri≈øhing ≈øtate</hi> of <hi>Communities,</hi> in the ways of <hi>Piety, Ju≈øtice,</hi> and <hi>Soberne≈øs;</hi> though I doubt not they added, that they might by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion be not only <hi>almo≈øt,</hi> but <hi>altogether Chri≈øtians;</hi> and not only <hi>not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> but that they might come from the <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> and the <hi>We≈øt,</hi> from <hi>the North</hi> and <hi>the South,</hi> and <hi>≈øit down in the Kingdom of God,</hi> to which the <hi>freedom of prophe≈øie</hi> under the Caution of <hi>Godline≈øs</hi> and <hi>Hone≈øty,</hi> might exceedingly conduce, on which account the Apo≈øtle goes on; <hi>This,</hi> that is, <hi>All this</hi> entercour≈øe, of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians prayers, Godline≈øs and Hone≈øty:</hi> and <hi>All Mens, Magi≈øtrates</hi> e≈øpecially procuring their <hi>peaceable and quiet lives, is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the ≈øight of God our Saviour, who would have all men to be ≈øaved,</hi> and by this means <hi>to come to the knowledg</hi> of the <hi>Truth,</hi> ≈øeeing the <hi>One God, the One Mediator, Author of the One natural, and the One true reveal'd Religion,</hi> is equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in all.</p>

                     <p>In An≈øwer to this I would re-enforce the≈øe three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the main of the Objection, there is ≈øo great a difference between <hi>Naturals</hi> that will certainly ri≈øe up at earne≈øt and vehement ≈øummons, being within already, though they may lye hid and deep; and what is purely from without and mu≈øt enter through tho≈øe <hi>multiform, Meander'd, twisted</hi> and <hi>twined pa≈ø≈øages</hi> of mens <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nderstandings</hi> and <hi>intellectual Belief,</hi> through varieties of Tempers, Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Principles, men have mo≈øt convers'd with, and rivetted their whole ≈øouls into; that it is impo≈ø≈øible for any but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65165:37"/> God alone, who ≈øearches the heart, to know, where the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ob≈øtruction lyes, when the ≈øcrews of truth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of mens minds do not reciprocate and an≈øwer one another; where the key of Truth and the wards of mens thoughts ≈øo di≈ø≈øent, as not to be reconciled; ≈øo that this mu≈øt be left for ever as to <hi>Divine Omnipotency</hi> in the efficacy, ≈øo to the <hi>Divine Judgment</hi> where the fault is, of mens not <hi>receiving</hi> what is ≈øo graciou≈øly <hi>offered from Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore to pretend to judg ob≈øtinacy, or in≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs, or whatever other faulty Rea≈øon we have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of mens not receiving the Religion we would impo≈øe, is to a≈ø≈øume Divine prerogative to our ≈øelves, and to become Judges in His peculiar Court, or to contrive an <hi>Artifice</hi> to cheat an <hi>acknowledged Principle,</hi> (viz. <hi>not compelling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion)</hi> of its <hi>due Obedience;</hi> and la≈øtly, to cloath innocent per≈øons, for any thing we know, with the <hi>Sambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> painted with Devils or Bea≈øts skins, wherein they may appear guilty with the di≈øgui≈øe we have put upon them, though out of that they cannot with Charity be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nocent, or guilty of tho≈øe particulars, we charge them with.</p>
                     <p>All this is to be under≈øtood, when the offence, and the particular offence (it being not enough in this ca≈øe to ≈øay there is ≈øome offence without <hi>≈øpecial matter charged</hi> again≈øt Natural Laws) is not as evident, as in any other ca≈øe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane judicature; and where the only proof that men are otherwi≈øe guilty in not receiving the Faith we offer them, is only this, that they do not receive it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If this puni≈øhing men for not receiving a Revealed Religion, were only for not receiving <hi>≈øub≈øtantial Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Religion,</hi> it were the more tollerable; though as I have ≈øaid, not de≈øirable to any <hi>true Chri≈øtian Prote≈øtant;</hi> but when it's ≈øtretch'd out to <hi>Fal≈øe Religion,</hi> to every <hi>nice Opinion, Ceremony</hi> or <hi>Mode of wor≈øhip,</hi> it is a <hi>burthen</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could never bear, being mo≈øt <hi>intollerable:</hi> And ≈øo I have done with <hi>this ≈øecond Argument.</hi>

                     <p> Argum. 3. I proceed to a third Argument, <hi>Ju≈øtifying Natural Religion to be the term of univer≈øal peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;</hi> ≈øo far that if that be ≈øecur'd, men ≈øhould acquie≈øce in peace one with another, in things that concern Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Magi≈øtrates allowing common protection, and people the common benevolence of Humanity; as upon a ruled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined ca≈øe,</hi> that <hi>Rea≈øon and Truth</hi> ought to have, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> and the very <hi>Laws of Nature, a Through fare in the world, free as the Air and Light,</hi> and that by an <hi>Ordinance as early as of the day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I argue this, I premi≈øe, That all Religious Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are under the <hi>intire acknowledgment of Princes</hi> within their own <hi>Dominions in all cau≈øes, and over all per≈øons, as well Eccle≈øia≈øtical, as Civil</hi> (in the very ≈øen≈øe of the Church of <hi>England) ≈øupreme Moderators, and Governours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As al≈øo, that it is more de≈øirable all things of a Religious concern ≈øhould have the countenance, encouragement, and example of <hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>Symphony of Communities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet ≈øtill with this <hi>condition,</hi> it is the <hi>Birthright</hi> of every man to be avowedly and publickly Religious, according to tho≈øe Rules he believers, agreeable to the <hi>Divine Will, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion being Judg.</hi> And that this is according to the very <hi>in≈øtitution of God him≈øelf,</hi> and no way incon≈øi≈øtent with the Laws of ≈øubjection to Magi≈øtracy, or being a <hi>commodious</hi> and <hi>agreeable member of a Community.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if there be not ≈øuch a <hi>Natural Freedom,</hi> there is no way left, ≈øince that general corruption of Religion in the world, for a man ordinarily to reduce him≈øelf, and induce others <hi>to reform them≈øelves and their open profe≈ø≈øion of God, to true and regular thoughts and acknowledgments of God, his wor≈øhip and ≈øervice,</hi> and the ways of plea≈øing him in order to the <hi>eternal enjoyment</hi> of him.</p>
                     <p>For it often falls out in the world, that Magi≈øtrates and People ≈øit in their <hi>Idol-Temple of a fal≈øe Religion,</hi> guarded with their Laws for Uniformity, environed with their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65165:38"/> own Canons and Con≈øtitutions, and threatning <hi>≈øeverest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties to any di≈øturber.</hi> Though we have rea≈øon <hi>to ble≈øs God our lines are fallen in plea≈øant places; yea we have a goodly inheritance</hi> of Religion by our Laws; which very much bribes our judgment of the <hi>Dure≈ø≈øe</hi> of <hi>Impo≈øitions in Religion,</hi> becau≈øe we only con≈øider it in <hi>ceremonies impos'd,</hi> and do not <hi>turn our ≈øelves to behold the abominations</hi> in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only committed but <hi>framed by a Law.</hi> But <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition</hi> is <hi>impo≈øition</hi> in the lea≈øt things in Religion, <hi>not natural;</hi> and opens the way to it in the greate≈øt.</p>
                     <p>If it be not therefore before hand taken care of by ≈øuch an <hi>Immunity,</hi> re≈øerv'd to <hi>Humane nature,</hi> notwith≈øtanding <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> to Rulers, that mo≈øt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> in <hi>Piety</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> i≈ø≈øuing it ≈øelf in <hi>declarations</hi> of his <hi>Name, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Glory; in charity and compa≈ø≈øion</hi> to the <hi>≈øouls of men,</hi> (who≈øe ca≈øe, though not them≈øelves, <hi>cry out, as the man of</hi> Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>in</hi> Paul<hi>'s vi≈øion, Come and help us)</hi> mu≈øt lye ≈øtill as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Act. 16. 9.</note> hid in a Napkin, and buried in the earth; or mu≈øt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fall foul with another <hi>Law of nature</hi> viz. of <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Magi≈øtrates</hi> in their Religious Laws.</p>

I confe≈øs this is mo≈øt true; yet ≈øtill it is to be con≈øider'd, what great care God hath of his <hi>Moral, Natural, Fundamental con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;</hi> and it is not at all to be believed, he would in ≈øo weighty a concern as <hi>Chri≈øtianity,</hi> have ≈øo far neglected his <hi>Ordinance of Magistracy,</hi> as not at fir≈øt to have pre≈øented that Doctrine, and the miraculous evidences of it to the <hi>Vicegerents</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> here upon earth; that at lea≈øt they ≈øhould have been guilty of a peremptory refu≈øal, before their <hi>deputation</hi> in the propagation of <hi>Chri≈øtian Religion</hi> had been waved by God. I cannot therefore account the Supremacy of Divine Power above Humane, the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that God took no more notice (not of Magi≈øtrates only, but) of Magi≈øtracy it ≈øelf, when he <hi>brought in the fir≈øt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and his <hi>Religion into the world;</hi> and that he did not ≈øay, <hi>Let all the≈øe Angels of God on earth wor≈øhip him,</hi> in the fir≈øt place.</p>
                     <p>We ≈øee in all things that could but have the appearance of being under their <hi>proper juri≈ødiction,</hi> how cautious our Saviour was not to offend; as in the ca≈øe of <hi>Tribute,</hi> though

                     <p>Be≈øides the <hi>propagation of Chri≈øtianity</hi> was to out-la≈øt the <hi>immediate commi≈ø≈øion</hi> of the <hi>Apo≈øtle≈øhip,</hi> and <hi>Miracles;</hi> and to ≈øurvive in ordinary preaching and di≈øcour≈øe, while the Princes of the world were yet enemies to it.</p>
                     <p>What then does this argue? but that the enforcing of true pure Natural Religion only, is the right of Earthly Powers. Not the retrenching any of the Freedoms of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, not the impo≈øing any thing be≈øides and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, by power or penalties; not the forbidding of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of any corruptions invading it; not the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going any Revelation from Heaven, con≈øi≈øting with, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Natural Religion, (as all truly ≈øuch do) only the power of requiring all to live in obedience to, the puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tho≈øe that di≈øobey <hi>Natural Laws.</hi>

                     <p>This is al≈øo mo≈øt true, it appears God did ≈øo intend.

And ≈øo far as they could judg, who did not believe, there was a real injury done to Powers, and the ≈øufferings of Chri≈øtians were on that account, ju≈øt.

                     <p> And ≈øo it is plain, If any man makes the other ≈øide of a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> the not ob≈øerving it, a point of Real, Sub≈øtantial Religion to him, is afraid of it, and values that <hi>fear</hi> as a <hi>fear of God,</hi> without the more intrin≈øick parts and effects of that Fear, he errs from Chri≈øtianity, as the Bigot for Ceremonies does.</p>
                     <p>But this does not imply, every one that pre≈øerves, and will not recede from his liberty, though he knows the <hi>true u≈øe</hi> and <hi>di≈øu≈øe</hi> of <hi>all things indifferent,</hi> yet will not be cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially bound by any on earth, is pre≈øently afraid of a Ceremony, or that he is ≈øo, becau≈øe he will not ≈øet it too near Divine In≈øtitutions in his practi≈øe, or incumber his wor≈øhip of God with it, though it be told him never ≈øo often; There is no Religion in the Impo≈øition, but Order, Decency, or Submi≈ø≈øion to Government.</p>

Gen. 41. 32.</note> and obligation lying upon Nations to National true Religion.</p>
                  <p>For ≈øeeing according to a grand Rule in Gods Admini≈øtration of the World, Nations that have no National Religion, and who≈øe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalne≈øs therefore becomes <hi>Heatheni≈øm,</hi> and is ≈øo branded by the Spirit of God, (for ≈øo Nations in Scripture very often ≈øignifies <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> that is, Nations without true Religion), are lyable to the <hi>pouring out of the wrath and fury of God</hi> upon them: It does not only follow by the rule of Contraries, that National true Religion<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> or Wor≈øhip of the true God, hath a ≈øtrong order to, and connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the favour of God; but as the po≈øitive Propo≈øition is the prime and original, and gives ground to, and contains within it ≈øelf the privative; ≈øo does this Propo≈øition, That Gods <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> is at all times ready again≈øt tho≈øe that do <hi>not know him,</hi> that do not <hi>call upon him</hi> as join'd in a <hi>National Body,</hi> or <hi>Society,</hi> being the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65165:79"/> privative, owe it ≈øelf to the other, being the po≈øitive; as ≈øhall be more fully made out in the arguing this Point.</p>
                  <p>At the pre≈øent, it will be enough to ob≈øerve, that the≈øe two Holy men, the <hi>Compo≈øer of this P≈øalm,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> (except as ≈øome think they were both one), de≈øiring the de≈øtruction of tho≈øe Heathen enemies under who≈øe oppre≈ø≈øion their own people (which at that time comprehended the Church of God) then groan'd, and praying <hi>in ≈øpirit</hi> for it, relye and re≈øt the whole weight of their prayer upon this principle of great truth and con≈øequence in Gods Government of the World, that as <hi>Families,</hi> as <hi>Nations,</hi> as <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> (for ≈øo all Communities are comprehended) they did not <hi>know</hi> nor <hi>call</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> that is, they did not wor≈øhip the <hi>true God;</hi> and therefore were mo≈øt ju≈øtly ≈øubject to his fierce≈øt di≈øplea≈øure.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ≈øide, it is couched under this, though indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, That the people that do know and call upon the true God, have a title to his ≈øavour, and vindication of them in all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈øs, while they are con≈øider'd as ≈øo <hi>knowing,</hi> and calling upon him, and not contradicting it by their actions. The Context therefore goes on arguing with God on this point, <hi>They have devoured Jacob,</hi> in who≈øe quarrel and re≈øcue God is ≈øo much concern'd.</p>
                  <p>And ≈øeeing the favour of God is Eternal Life, and his wrath burns to the lowe≈øt Hell; both his wrath and his favour are to be under≈øtood in their extent even to everla≈øting ages.</p>
                  <p>All which will ground the Propo≈øition, which I mainly intend in this Di≈øcour≈øe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That National true Religion is the greate≈øt ≈øecurity, ≈øtrength and defence of a Nation again≈øt the Divine wrath and di≈øplea≈øure, and gives the ≈øure≈øt claim to his favour, ble≈ø≈øing and protection, both in this world, and in that which is to come.</hi> Becau≈øe it is an ob≈øervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greate≈øt duty; and therefore to be mo≈øt clo≈øely united in, and pur≈øued to the utmo≈øt by all wi≈øe Nations, and by all the ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, and members of a Nation; for it is their fir≈øt and highe≈øt <note place="margin">P≈øal. 33. i2 &amp; 144. 15.</note> Intere≈øt: <hi>Ble≈ø≈øed is the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And this very con≈øideration ≈øhould reconcile all differences in National Religion, that can be compo≈øed without lo≈øs of that Truth, and corruption of tho≈øe parts of the Wor≈øhip of God, which give denomination to true National Religion.</p>
                  <p>This ≈øhould incline tho≈øe that are above, to the greate≈øt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcen≈øions, and tho≈øe that are beneath to the mo≈øt free compliances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:79"/> po≈ø≈øible, if they value Religion, and love their Nation, that at lea≈øt there may be union in National Religion, if there cannot be perfect Uniformity. For I am fully per≈øwaded, that upon a ≈øtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Point, it will be found that National Religion (≈øuppo≈øing it always the true) is the happie≈øt model of union in Religion of any upon earth, and mo≈øt plea≈øing to God, except that of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> who≈øe union is in the Sub≈øtantials of Truth, wor≈øhip and practi≈øe, but comes under no other form or model properly taken: but except this, there is none ≈øo perfect to the ends and glory of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ≈øo adaequate to the expre≈ø≈øions of Scripture concerning the publickne≈øs of Religion, ≈øo encouraging and advantageous to the practi≈øe, ≈øo reconcileable with the peace of Religion and Nations, ≈øo preventive of the endle≈øs divi≈øions, and ≈øubdivi≈øions Humane Nature is apt to fall into, when it yields up it ≈øelf to a ≈øcrupulo≈øity, and Di≈øputatiou≈øne≈øs about Externals and Forms in Religion.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øay again, I am per≈øwaded no man can ≈øerve God with greater acceptablene≈øs, nor be Religious to greater ends and purpo≈øes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than by joining with the Nation, or Supream Civil Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereof he is a member, ≈øo far as he can be permitted to do it, con≈øi≈øtent with the Truth of Religion, and Divine Wor≈øhip. I ≈øay, as far as he can upon the≈øe accounts, if not throughout.</p>
                  <p>And of this I ≈øhall endeavour to give great and valuable proofs from Scripture, and Rea≈øon agreeable to it, and deduced from it; and herein being a <hi>Mini≈øter of God</hi> according to the <hi>National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I magnifie my Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpo≈øe I will fir≈øt con≈øider of the Radical obligation we have to join our ≈øelves with others in the profe≈ø≈øion of Religion, and Wor≈øhip of God, and how it ri≈øes from Per≈øonal Religion, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtratum</hi> or foundation of all; and by what degrees it mu≈øt and ought to ri≈øe, and how it mo≈øt rationally determines it ≈øelf in National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It ought to attempt thus high, and cannot ≈øucce≈øsfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt higher in the way of A≈ø≈øociation; to ≈øpread thus far, and cannot expatiate to any purpo≈øe beyond it: I ≈øhall therefore here give ≈øuch Arguments for <hi>National Religion</hi> out of Scripture, as it does not afford to any other figure of union in it.</p>
                  <p>In the fir≈øt place therefore it nece≈ø≈øarily mu≈øt be ≈øuppos'd and granted, That Per≈øonal Religion is the Fundamental Religion; even as a Nation, or even Univer≈øality of Humane Nature mu≈øt become a notion without particular per≈øons, in whom all Communities ≈øub≈øi≈øt; even ≈øo mu≈øt <hi>National,</hi> or <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> vani≈øh into imagination,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65165:80"/> if it were not ≈øu≈øtained by particular and Per≈øonal piety; <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Families calling upon God,</hi> mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily imply and include the particular per≈øons of each doing ≈øo.</p>
                  <p>And herein it is further con≈øiderable, that every man is a compleat Being within him≈øelf; that as it is ≈øaid of him, He is in his Soul and Body a little World within him≈øelf, ≈øo he is a Kingdom, a Society within him≈øelf; and we may ≈øay in this ≈øen≈øe, He is a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him≈øelf al≈øo, as <hi>Solomon</hi> calling him≈øelf <hi>Coheleth,</hi> the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Eccle≈øia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtes.</note> or the <hi>Preaching ≈øoul,</hi> in that great Treaty with him≈øelf, ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his ≈øoul a Congregation, and a Preacher within and to it ≈øelf fir≈øt, and then to the publick; ≈øo ought every man to be to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore is the fir≈øt inviolable duty and obligation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becau≈øe a man can never be ab≈øent from him≈øelf; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible for any force to ≈øurprize the pa≈ø≈øages of a ≈øoul to Heaven, or to hinder the ≈øouls Congregating in Holy Meditations, and Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øes within it ≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>And as a man is thus con≈øider'd, he cannot nor ought to ≈øuffer him≈øelf to be impos'd upon, or commanded without Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for as thus con≈øider'd, he cannot be forced by any, and he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4, 12.</note> countable only to God: <hi>He ≈øtands or falls to his own Ma≈øter: Every one ≈øhall give account of him≈øelf to God;</hi> which is one of the greate≈øt Arguments the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> in≈øi≈øts upon for mutual forbearance in di≈øpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things in Religion; every man on this account ought to be <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15</note> able to <hi>render a rea≈øon of the hope that is in him,</hi> to him≈øelf and others; and not to re≈øt in an <hi>implicite faith.</hi> It will be no mans excu≈øe he was led or commanded into a fal≈øe Faith, or Idolatrous wor≈øhip.</p>
                  <p>Every man al≈øo upon this ≈øame account is bound <hi>to make confe≈ø≈øion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>with his mouth to ≈øalvation</hi> in his proper place and ≈øtation; and in a narrower ≈øen≈øe, yet a ≈øen≈øe as large as his capacity and rank, every true Chri≈øtian is a <hi>Pillar, and Ground of Truth;</hi> that is, Truth mu≈øt <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> be ≈øetled, and ≈øtrongly ≈øeated in his ≈øoul, and he mu≈øt expo≈øe Truth, and bear it out in Confe≈ø≈øion and holy practi≈øe, and is him≈øelf a Temple or Hou≈øe of the living God, where God will plea≈øe to walk and dwell; and therefore can be no way obliged to join with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or any ≈øort of larger Community in a fal≈øe Religion, though he ≈øhould ≈øtand alone in the true, or ≈øhould, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> for≈øake his <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>his Fathers Hou≈øe</hi> to do it.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwith≈øtanding this, <hi>It is not good for a man to be alone,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 1. Gen. 2. 18.</note> though in true Religion, if it can be otherwi≈øe; he is made for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65165:80"/> Society and is, as it were, imperfect without it: Herein he re≈øembles God in ≈øome low degree, in who≈øe <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>likene≈øs</hi> he is made. God is an infinitely perfect Being in him≈øelf, yet he hath plea≈øed him≈øelf in communicativene≈øs to all his Creatures, and in the attraction of all in their ≈øeveral kinds, e≈øpecially <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to him≈øelf; as if he was not ≈øatisfied in being holy, in being happy alone.</p>
                  <p>Thus man, though if he could not have ≈øociety in True Religion, he would be yet a complete and ab≈øolute Figure alone; yet where, and ≈øo far as he can have ≈øociety in it, he is ≈øo far from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete alone, that he mu≈øt needs prove a Cypher, a Nothing, if he affected and coveted to be alone: Whatever he has, if he has not <hi>Love,</hi> he is <hi>nothing; God is Love,</hi> and therefore rejoyces in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from him≈øelf and with him≈øelf, and ≈øo mu≈øt, ≈øo does every good man, every holy man al≈øo.</p>
                  <p>If there be True Per≈øonal Religion, there mu≈øt be Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for Man is made for Society; and if he meets, he mu≈øt meet with that Religjous Sen≈øe he has upon him≈øelf, with that I ≈øay he mu≈øt meet with others, which ≈øeems the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society. For if a man meets with his own Religion others that have the ≈øame ≈øen≈øe of Religion, there ari≈øes a nece≈ø≈øity of the Religion of all to meet together.</p>
                  <p>But further, Man was made for Society, and the fir≈øt and ≈øupreme end of ≈øociety, as of all things, is the glory of God; and therefore ≈øociety is in the fir≈øt place bound to be Religious ≈øociety. Marriage the Root and beginning of ≈øociety, was, that there might be <hi>a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øeed, Mal.</hi> 2. 15. to ≈øu≈øtain a Succe≈ø≈øion of Religion: So ≈øociety ≈øpreads on ≈øtill, that there might be Religious Societies.</p>
                  <p>As ≈øoon therefore as <hi>Seth,</hi> the fir≈øt De≈øcendent from <hi>Adam</hi> in the holy Line, had a Son born in the ≈øame Line, it is recorded, that <hi>Then Men began to call upon the Name of</hi> Jehovah, that is mo≈øt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> took it as a ju≈øt and nece≈ø≈øary occa≈øion, not <note place="margin">Gen. 4. ult.</note> only to ≈øet up a pillar of Thankfulne≈øs in ≈øeeing them≈øelves the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors of the <hi>ble≈ø≈øed Seed,</hi> but in the fore≈øight of a holy ≈øociety, ju≈øt ready to ≈øpring from their loyns, they thought fit to promote Divine Wor≈øhip into a publick State and certain Order; and this I think the mo≈øt agreeable Interpretation of that controverted place: ≈øo that from the beginning of the world, all along the Hi≈øtory of True Religion in the Old and New Te≈øtament, we ≈øhall find Religion contended into publickne≈øs, and all the advantages of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65165:81"/>
                  <p> Yea Humane Nature hath taken this ≈øo for granted, that it is doubtful whether there ever was a ≈øociety in the world, politically united or not wholly barbarous, but it was cemented in Religion, though being ≈øo generally but fal≈øe Religion, it proved no better than Heatheni≈øm.</p>
                  <p>There may have been private Cabals of Athei≈øm, but there never was a publick A≈ø≈øociation again≈øt <hi>A God known and believed,</hi> except in Hell. If we could ≈øuppo≈øe a Society de≈øignedly united without Religion, it would be like the Plot for building of <hi>Babel,</hi> an endeavour of ≈øuch a part of mankind to ≈øet up for its ≈øelf and its own ≈øecurity, as it were in defyance of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>A Society united in Civils, and crumbled into Sects and Divi≈øions in Religion, that is, in the main ≈øub≈øtantials of Doctrine, Wor≈øhip, and Practice, is a <hi>Babel,</hi> as it was under the cur≈øe of Confu≈øion, of divided Language; A di≈øparagement of Religion, which can be as it is indeed Religion, but one; as if its <hi>Name</hi> were <hi>Legion,</hi> or as if in fundamental points it could not ≈øufficiently evidence it ≈øelf, ≈øo as to be known to be the true: La≈øtly a di≈øanulling the ancient Law of Society, which is principally for the Union of Religion; ≈øo that if men could agree in all things el≈øe, and were yet divided here, it were not true humane ≈øociety, but would want the very noble≈øt part or Principle of it, Religion, which is as a ≈øoul or ≈øpirit to it.</p>
                  <p>Yet too rigorous and ≈øevere a con≈øtraint of Uniformity, is both to forget humane infirmity, that does not allow ≈øo perfect an union in this world, (if a rigid Uniformity be indeed perfection) and to forget al≈øo that every man is a complete Being within him≈øelf, and makes a perfect Figure as he is alone; and therefore to grant nothing to this con≈øideration, is rather to crowd men into a <hi>Little ea≈øe</hi> in Religion, than to unite them; and ≈øo pre≈ø≈øing them too ≈øtrait, makes them fly out of that unea≈øie ≈øtate for more room, and di≈ø≈øolves the union that might el≈øe have been.</p>
                  <p>But in all the principal points of True Religion, Union is ≈øo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary, that it ≈øtands good; <hi>Humane ≈øociety is for the ≈øake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> yet in this ≈øtate of Gods patience to the world, Commerce, and civil Conver≈øation are no more than Property founded in Grace, for then we mu≈øt <hi>go out of the world,</hi> yet ≈øtill the ≈øupreme and prime end of Society is Religion.</p>
                  <p>Society in Divine Adorations is the ≈øtate of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven: It was de≈øigned to be the State of Innocency in this world. It is a Law that cannot be repealed; It is the perpetual Duty of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65165:81"/> Man: Fallen Nature hath a violent inclination to it, ≈øo that all ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietyes con≈øent to <hi>walk in the name of ≈øome God,</hi> though mi≈øtaken in the right object. But the word of God and Chri≈øtianity, as they mo≈øt clearly reveal the True Religion ≈øo the nece≈ø≈øity of Union in it.</p>
                  <p>The publickne≈øs of Religion therefore, that it is mo≈øt choo≈øable for the glory of it to God, for the good it does to the ≈øouls of men, for the ble≈ø≈øing and acceptance it receives from God; I ≈øhall plainly make evident from the rea≈øon of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Glory publick Religion pre≈øents to God, it is evident, although God in his Son and Spirit is a ≈øufficient Spectator and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of, and infinitely rich in his own Glory, in the under≈øtanding of, and his own eternal prai≈øes of him≈øelf, ≈øo that nothing can be added to him; yet it is mo≈øt evident, God is plea≈øed to delight in the publickne≈øs of his ≈øervice, and the neare≈øt approach of all his Creatures to him, and that not in ≈øolitary ≈øervice, but the mo≈øt conjoyn'd, as if infinity received Additions of Glory from the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and publickne≈øs of his Wor≈øhip, which yet we know is impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible. But it is the aby≈øs of his goodne≈øs, that he delights in loving all his creatures, and being univer≈øally known, loved, and ≈øerved by them, and that in the greate≈øt Union herein, that as he him≈øelf is the prime Unity and Univer≈øality, and this is the perfection of his Being; ≈øo his Creatures ≈øprung from him may return to him in the ≈øame Univer≈øality and Unity, in re≈øemblance of him≈øelf, which is the highe≈øt and true≈øt wor≈øhip of him.</p>
                  <p>In Heaven there is an <hi>Innumerable company of Angels,</hi> and <hi>ble≈ø≈øed Spirits, in one general A≈ø≈øembly,</hi> to prai≈øe and wor≈øhip God.

And every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and ≈øuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them I heard, ≈øaying, as it were in one Quire: Ble≈ø≈øing, and Honour, and Glory,</hi>

                     <hi>and power be unto him that ≈øitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> al≈øo mu≈øters up the whole Creation to join in the prai≈øes of God, not to fill up and adorn the <hi>Divine Poe≈øie,</hi> but to ≈øhew the indi≈øputable right God hath to the ≈øervices of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that in tho≈øe which are not able to pay it immediately by them≈øelves, every <hi>wi≈øe</hi> and <hi>prudent holy man</hi> is to ob≈øerve that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of prai≈øe that is as it were marked upon them by the wi≈ødom that made them, and to offer it up for them, when the ≈øervice of God is repre≈øented, as mo≈øt glorious in its being mo≈øt publick.</p>
                  <p>Every thing therefore in Gods Ordination of Religion, tends to publickne≈øs; <hi>Our Saviour</hi> will not appear but in the <hi>fulne≈øs of his Body,</hi> the Church, which does as it were compleat him: For it is in this ≈øen≈øe his <hi>Complement</hi> or <hi>Fulne≈øs,</hi> though he fills <hi>all in all.</hi> The knowledg of God would cover the earth <hi>even as water does the Sea,</hi> and is re≈øtle≈øs, till it does; ≈øo the Preaching of the Go≈øpel is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>all Nations, to every creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Prayer there is to be a coming of all fle≈øh to God. Prai≈øe is to ri≈øe up as one pillar of Incen≈øe from the whole world. The Church e≈øpecially is to publi≈øh the name of the Lord, and to a≈øcribe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to our God.</p>
                  <p>Now the ≈øen≈øe of this is, that ≈øince God hath been plea≈øed to place his Glory in the publickne≈øs of Religion, in this Univer≈øality of it, all good men are zealous and earne≈øt to draw in the publick Societies of the world, as much as they can, to love, fear, ≈øerve, pray to God, and prai≈øe him together.</p>
                  <p>God does not allow his ≈øervants that out of choice they ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Religion of a Cloy≈øter, or a Wilderne≈øs, or a private ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated A≈ø≈øembly, as the greate≈øt honour to him, but delights in the mo≈øt publick A≈ø≈øemblies of his Saints, ≈øervants, and creatures; for though the rea≈øons here of lye deep in the Divine Wi≈ødom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, yet it is ≈øpoken to us in the plaine≈øt Language, as if God carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as Princes do in their magnificence, who≈øe Glory is in their great Courts, in the multitude of their Attendants, and People, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, Admirers, and Tributaries to their lu≈øter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I argue to the publickne≈øs of Religion from the good it does to the ≈øouls of men. It is from hence the greate≈øt wi≈ødom <hi>to win ≈øouls;</hi> and they <hi>that turn many to righteou≈øne≈øs, ≈øhall ≈øhine as the ≈øtars.</hi> Now the offer of true Religion to them that had it not before, the per≈øwa≈øion of it upon tho≈øe that have not yet obeyed it, tends to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65165:82"/> Conver≈øion, Repentance, to their love and fear of God. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that have the true ≈øen≈øe of the≈øe things in their own ≈øouls u≈øe all means out of love to the Glory of God, and to the ≈øouls of men to propagate them to others, which is be≈øt done by all publick acts of Religion: This is the original Law, from the very beginning it was ≈øo: <hi>Enoch the ≈øeventh from Adam prophecyed</hi> publickly, <hi>The Lord cometh with ten thou≈øands of his Saints. Noah was a Preacher of Righteou≈øne≈øs.</hi> This was the great zeal of Chri≈øtians in the fir≈øt times.</p>
                  <p>Further, It ≈øtrengthens, confirms, and inflames Religion among tho≈øe that are the joynt Profe≈ø≈øors: Publick Religion is the great glory and ≈øecurity of Religion it ≈øelf, mutually warming and a≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ≈øelf in all its ≈øeveral parts, and the Profe≈ø≈øors of it. <hi>As Iron ≈øharpens Iron, ≈øo is the countenance of a man to his Friend herein.</hi> How much more lively is Religion probable to be in a Religious, than an Athei≈øtick and Barbarous Country? nor does God afford tho≈øe divine heats to tho≈øe that withdraw from A≈ø≈øemblies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, except in ca≈øes of nece≈ø≈øity, however he may ≈øupply in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exigences, without which, <hi>Wo to him that is alone in Religion, if he fall he has not any to help him up: and how can one be warm alone? If one prevails again≈øt him, he wants a Second to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand together with him, and the benefit of the threefold cord, that is not ea≈øily broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every thing in nature endeavours towards Community or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Unity, as its own ≈øtrength and ≈øecurity. Even the <hi>Devils</hi> retain ≈øo much of fir≈øt Nature, as to knit in a community; and fal≈øe Chri≈øtianity imitates the true in a pretence to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øality,</hi> though a mo≈øt de≈øtructive one, like that of <hi>the God of this World,</hi> who a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires to Univer≈øal Monarchy, but it is in ≈øin and death.</p>
                  <p>But this does not di≈øparage True Religion, moving to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øality of Truth, Peace, and Life for evermore.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ble≈ø≈øing and acceptance that Religion receives from the Divine Maje≈øty, is much greater for the publickne≈øs of it; even in this ≈øence, <hi>Two are better than one, for they have a good reward for their labour.</hi> In thss ≈øence their complicated ≈øervices are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, <hi>their threefold Cord is not ea≈øily broken.</hi> Not that God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to any change in him≈øelf or his Government by the ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of his Creatures, though in a multitude; but he is plea≈øed to found the occa≈øions and opportunities of his own mo≈øt bountiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences, in the drawing near of their greater numbers: For as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65165:83"/> when God was plea≈øed to communicate him≈øelf more freely, he did it to a multitude of Creatures; ≈øo he delights in receiving back the glory of having thus communicated him≈øelf from a multitude al≈øo; and as there is more of him≈øelf in more of his Creatures, whether of ≈øeveral ≈øorts or of the ≈øame, ≈øo there is more of his ble≈ø≈øing in their approaches to him.</p>
                  <p>He that does not only <hi>weigh the Mountains in ≈øcales, but compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the du≈øt of the earth in a mea≈øure,</hi> takes notice of tho≈øe prayers and de≈øires of the <hi>poor of the people,</hi> that make the crowd and throng in his wor≈øhip and ≈øervice: He accepts the pair of <hi>Turtle Doves,</hi> the <hi>two Mites,</hi> when it is <hi>the All,</hi> and is ready to reward it.</p>
                  <p>This was the policy of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s Natural Religion, to unite their Force in Humiliation, Fa≈øting, and Prayer, and to take advantage of joyning the mute de≈øires of the Bea≈øts, that have a voice in the ears of God: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant made the <hi>Camels kneel down</hi> while he prayed to God.</p>
                  <p>Thus in Thank≈øgivings, It was <hi>David</hi>'s art to gather up all the prai≈øes, even of the lowe≈øt of the Creatures, that could ≈øo meanly give them, and in≈øpiring them with his own rea≈øon, made them, as it were, to follow his Harp, and unite in his own <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> Thus he ≈øerved him≈øelf of them, that making by them a greater pre≈øent of glory to God, he might receive the greater ble≈ø≈øing from him. The <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> ≈øpeaks of the good effect of <hi>Chri≈øtian Charity,</hi> in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing an <hi>abundance of thanksgivings to God.</hi> David ≈øaying, <hi>The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the people would compa≈øs God about,</hi> adds this prayer; <hi>therefore for their ≈øakes return thou on high.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now all the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions, reporting to us a great force in the publickne≈øs of Religious Duties, we know it is only from the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs of this publickne≈øs with the Divine Will and Nature, and his holy Ordination, who loves his <hi>Saints,</hi> and knows their approach to him is an approach to their life and happine≈øs: And becau≈øe he <hi>loves all his Saints and Creatures</hi> the more of them in conjunction draw near to him, the more of his <hi>tender mercies</hi> have the occa≈øion to ≈øpread them≈øelves; <hi>for el≈øe all the Nations are to God, but as the drop of the Bucket, and the du≈øt of the Ballance; all their ≈øervices are not ≈øufficient to him for a ≈øacrifice to burn before him: He humbles him≈øelf to behold the things that are in Heaven, as well as tho≈øe on Earth.</hi> He with great delight yet looks to one <hi>that is of a broken and contrite ≈øpirit, and that trembles at his word. As one day and a thou≈øand years are both alike to the Infinity of God, ≈øo are a thou≈øand per≈øons and but one;</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65165:83"/> 
                     <hi>as it is all one to him to ≈øave with many or few,</hi> ≈øo it is to be intreated by them in prayer, or accept their prai≈øe; but according to the wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and holine≈øs of the Divine Manife≈øtation in his Love and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ≈øo he is plea≈øed to ≈øee his Servants draw near to him in an union of Love among them≈øelves, and every one having a claim to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who is all Goodne≈øs, the united claim is ≈øtronger. <hi>He hears even the Ravens that cry,</hi> for they are his Creatures; if any man therefore could intwi≈øt their cry with his own in a general ≈øcarcity, he makes his own ≈øo much the ≈øtronger. He then that joyns the prayers and de≈øires of many with his own, doubles ≈øtill the ≈øtrength, as is manife≈øt by the Apo≈øtles ≈øo often and earne≈øtly de≈øiring the help of prayers.</p>
                  <p>And this may an≈øwer what may ≈øeem to be an objection again≈øt good men joyning with publick and promi≈øcuous A≈ø≈øemblies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ≈øo many ignorant and bad men, that by their ≈øins, ignorance, and folly, rather ob≈øtruct the effect and acceptance of good men joyning with them; ≈øo that it may ≈øeem better if holy and good men ≈øeparated them≈øelves, and left the generality of a Nation out of their Religious Services.</p>
                  <p>But from what hath been ≈øaid it is very plain, that as the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The ≈øervices of men not truly Religious, are not ≈øo acceptable to God alone, but are ennobled by the union of truly good men; for that they have ≈øuch a vertue is plain; even <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, though good men them≈øelves, received good by his offering their ≈øacrifices; and that good men may ≈øubject the ≈øervices of evil men to their own, is as plain by the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> rejoycing, that <hi>Chri≈øt was preached by tho≈øe that preached him out of envy and contention, for while his preaching Chri≈øt out of love,</hi> over ruled theirs, who <hi>preached the ≈øame Chri≈øt</hi> from wor≈øer re≈øpects; all their preaching of Chri≈øt was ≈øo forcibly united with the Apo≈øtles, that it became as if it was wholly his own, &amp; <hi>turned to his Salvation;</hi> the greater &amp; truer Light drinking up the le≈øs, &amp; the le≈øs noble which followed in attendance upon it; &amp; ≈øo much more the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65165:84"/> prayers of le≈øs worthy men are ≈ønatched up to Heaven with the prayers of Holy men, and prevail for a full acceptance of them with God, leaving only ≈øome le≈ø≈øer portions of Ble≈ø≈øing to tho≈øe who≈øe Hearts do not a≈øcend with their prayers: Yet we mu≈øt be careful of ≈øaying to any, <hi>Stand off, I am holier than thou.</hi> Many a man being rejected under the Appearance of a <hi>Publican,</hi> who≈øe heart's breaking within it ≈øelf to God has greater acceptance from him, than what ≈øeems rather to be preferr'd among men.</p>
                  <p>For the Honour therefore of the mo≈øt publick Conjunction in Holy Services, we may ob≈øerve, tho≈øe men who are of the mo≈øt Happy memory in Scripture, Men of Renown for the Efficacy of their prayers, as <hi>Noah, Mo≈øes, Samuel Job, Daniel,</hi> the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and many others, were no Monki≈øh ≈øort of men; No men of Separation from the publique upon choice, but Per≈øonages, as of the mo≈øt Divine ≈øpreading Rea≈øon, ≈øo of a publique Wi≈ødom, Grace, and Spirit, containing a publique Intere≈øt, and Piety within their own Brea≈øts; yet joyning with as many as they could, to better their ≈øervices mutually, and not ≈øcrupling union with them, le≈øt they ≈øhould be made wor≈øe, or their ≈øervices le≈øs acceptable; Men of no narrow and contracted Spirits, Principles or Devotion, but like our Saviours conver≈øe with <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> they were as <hi>Phy≈øicians to the ≈øick, Helps to the weak,</hi> as well as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parions of all that fear God, pulling ≈øinners with violence out of the Fire, converting them from the error of their way, ≈øaving ≈øouls from Death, and endeavouring to hide the multitude of ≈øins;</hi> and therefore were ≈øo prevalent in prayers for others, though at ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God was ≈øo incens'd, as to deny Audience even to ≈øuch, except for their own ≈øouls.</p>
                  <p>Thus clear it is on the ≈øide of Publique Religion in the≈øe great Examples; they ≈øeparated from the ≈øins, the ≈øuper≈øtitions, that were at any time become publique, but joyn'd with the Publique Religion, and thereby rais'd it to much higher Excellency: It is impo≈ø≈øible to make bad Things good, as Fal≈øe Wor≈øhip, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Practi≈øe, if never ≈øo many Good men fell into them; It would endanger them, but cannot better that, which is of it ≈øelf bad: But that which is in it ≈øelf Good, which would be much di≈øpirited through Evil handling it, by Bad men, may be made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Holy mens Predominancy, and A≈øcendency in it; and ≈øo turn to general Good, in <hi>≈øome Thirty,</hi> in <hi>≈øome Sixty,</hi> in <hi>≈øome an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredfold;</hi> which ≈øhews the Nature of the both Communicativene≈øs

                  <p>I have now di≈øpatched this fir≈øt Head I propo≈øed concerning the publickne≈øs of Religion in general: I come now to the ≈øecond Head, <hi>That this publickne≈øs determines it ≈øelf in National Religion, neither ≈øtaying ≈øhort of it, nor expatiating beyond it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to make good this, I fir≈øt con≈øider how humane Society ri≈øes, and what are the fir≈øt bands of Union. And it is very evident the fir≈øt A≈ø≈øociations of mankind mu≈øt grow out of Families, as I have ob≈øerv'd the Law of Humane Society was fir≈øt declar'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd upon the In≈øtitution of Marriage. This was the beginning of Families, Families of all greater a≈ø≈øociations of men. Here al≈øo mu≈øt begin all Religious Society. The≈øe are the mo≈øt near and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd; here therefore are the mo≈øt frequent ≈øea≈øons of wor≈øhipping God, of daily prai≈øes of him, and prayers to him. The examples of it we find in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, <hi>Jo≈øhua</hi>'s, <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Families, and the Churches in the Hou≈øes of ≈øome Chri≈øtians at the fir≈øt. This Dome≈øtick Body is mo≈øt clo≈øe with it ≈øelf, and more ea≈øily call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, therefore the fir≈øt ≈øeat of Religious Society.</p>
                  <p>Families therefore for the clo≈øene≈øs, nearne≈øs, and naturalne≈øs of that Government, as being the ≈ømalle≈øt of Communities, but the mo≈øt primitive, are particularly nam'd in this Prayer again≈øt the Heathen, and made another expre≈ø≈øion together with Kingdoms of Irreligious Communities.</p>
                  <p>For as Kingdoms are greater Families, united indeed as Families but greater.</p>
                  <p>So Families though le≈ø≈øer, were yet the fir≈øt Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Religion therefore being a mo≈øt unconte≈øtable duty and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in tho≈øe le≈ø≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r Kingdoms, Families, it argues to the ≈øame obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and duty in tho≈øe greater Families, Kingdoms, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Irreligion of the one and the other run along one with the other.</p>
                  <p>Thus God fir≈øt eminently him≈øelf founded Religion in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and ≈øo commenc'd both the Family and Religion into a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kingdom. Religion therefore ri≈øes higher, and ≈øettles here as upon the mo≈øt advantageous Eminences, as in the mo≈øt full and free ≈øpread Communities, call'd Nations for their greatne≈øs and numerou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, Kingdoms for their Maje≈øtick government and union in it.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65165:85"/>
                  <p> For a Nation or Kingdom is a part of Mankind canton'd indeed from the whole world, and the widene≈øs of that, yet into a larger compa≈øs than Neighbourhoods, Towns or Cities, and is generally inclo≈øed within ≈øome more remarkable bounds of place, as Seas, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Mountains; united by nearne≈øs of Manners, Cu≈øtoms, and Di≈øpo≈øition, ari≈øing from like Temperature of Air and Climate, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Conver≈øation and Commerce, having one and the ≈øame Language, but e≈øpecially as under the ≈øame Civil Intere≈øts, Laws, Government, and Legi≈ølative Authority.</p>
                  <p>For the≈øe mutual Bonds are they which give Rea≈øon to National Religion, as the mo≈øt ≈øolemn in≈øtance of publick Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip of God, becau≈øe by vertue of the≈øe it becomes one great Family.</p>
                  <p>I know there may be ≈øome exceptions from this de≈øcription of a Nation, which will have their force upon National Religion al≈øo as it re≈øults from it. For ≈øometimes one Monarchy does as it were ≈øtride over more Nations, ≈øometimes one City or Free Town is di≈øtingui≈øht from the re≈øt of the World by one Government, one Civil Intere≈øt, independent in its Government in its proper Intere≈øt upon any other.</p>
                  <p>Now in ≈øuch a Monarchy as contains ≈øeveral People and Nations under it, it does not properly give name to a National Religion, while their Intere≈øts, Laws, Conver≈øation, and Civil Commerce are pre≈øerved and kept di≈øtinct, as the≈øe are often allowed to be under ≈øome conquering Potentacy.</p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide if a narrower compa≈øs of people than we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call a Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> a Region, a Province, a City, hath its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts, its Laws, its Government, Conver≈øation and Commerce, intire to it ≈øelf; it is as to the purpo≈øe we are now upon, as it were a Nation.</p>
                  <p>The ≈øum then is this: ≈øo far as Humane Society has drawn any People or Families into a clo≈øe and more compacted ≈øtate of Civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øts, nece≈ø≈øitude one to another, and Government running up to the highe≈øt point of Government in that compact ≈øtate, ≈øo far is the obligation of Union in publick Religion drawn upon them; where the≈øe are freer, that attendance to union in Religion is freer al≈øo, any further than the common truth of Religion, and the obligations of that, bind even tho≈øe at greate≈øt di≈øtance and union one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>For thus Religion may and ought to unite all the true Profe≈ø≈øors of it, at what remove ≈øoever from one another. It may and ought

Even ≈øo of National Religion, not as Religion; for the ≈øtandard of that is Scripture only: but as National; ≈øo the Agreement in it is depo≈øited with all other National Acts. So that National Religion hath the advantage in the≈øe two things: Fir≈øt, The Naturalne≈øs and Clo≈øene≈øs of the Union of a Nation to all the Intere≈øts of Humane Society; and therein it imitates the nearne≈øs and clo≈øene≈øs of Families, or le≈ø≈øer Incorporations, as much as can be con≈øi≈øtent with the ≈øecond thing, <hi>viz</hi> The Illu≈øtriou≈øne≈øs, Magnificence, Honourablene≈øs of Religion, as ≈øeated in larger Bodies, but e≈øpecially as upon the Soveraignties and Supremacies of the Great Incorporations of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>The Imaginary Benefits of ≈øuch ≈øorts of Union are infinitely toil≈øome, and tedious, while they are expected, and always in the i≈ø≈øue found impo≈ø≈øible to be enjoyed in their Fruits; but in the mean time, while the pretenders are labouring for, and gra≈øping at ≈øo va≈øt a power, they fill the world with the lamentable effects of their Ambition, and do indeed de≈øtroy Humane Society, becau≈øe tho≈øe Laws and Bands that tye it together, being ≈øo over-≈øtrain'd, fly in pieces; and I am ≈øure nothing is more contrary to <hi>Chri≈øtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> than an <hi>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>The fir≈øt Argument ≈øhall be,</hi> that I derive from this prayer, I <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> have cho≈øen to di≈øcour≈øe this point upon: and I lay it thus. The prayers, in which <hi>Holy men ≈øpake, as they were moved by the Holy Gho≈øt,</hi> re≈øt upon ≈øome great Pillars and Principles of Divine Truth, and Argument: For particular ca≈øes, in which they prayed, are brought to tho≈øe general principles, by an under≈øtanding inlightned to under≈øtand, in an humble ≈øen≈øe, even as God under≈øtands, and inflam'd with a Holy Affection, in a lowly Imitation of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Zeal,</hi> wherewith God performs all his <hi>Holy Ordinations.</hi> Thus as <hi>Princes they have power with God,</hi> becau≈øe they offer him their Petitions according to his E≈øtabli≈øhed Rules of Government, and his own <hi>Holy Will,</hi> concerning the things, wherein they pray to him.</p>
                  <p>Now the under≈øtanding the≈øe Rules was extraordinary, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and Servants of God in≈øpir'd by him, but to us in ordinary by the light of the Word of God, by the Laws of True and Right Rea≈øon in deductions from that word: And in which word, and the deductions from it, if we are not mi≈øtaken, the Efficacy will be certain, becau≈øe if we <hi>ask according to his will, we are ≈øure he heareth us, and that we have in ≈øome true ≈øen≈øe the Petitions we ask of him.</hi> This is ≈øo valuable a Rule of prayer, that <hi>Daniel,</hi> though ≈øo great a <hi>Man of Vi≈øion,</hi> yet betook him≈øelf to this ordinary means of In≈øtruction in the mind of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. By Books of Holy Records, and general Chronology, he knew that the time of the <hi>Babyloni≈øh Captivity</hi> was near its Expiration, and ≈øo <hi>≈øet him≈øelf to prayer,</hi> and was crown'd with this wonderful ≈øucce≈øs and acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Thus prayers prevail with God, and yet without any change in him, there being a Configuration, or Concurrence of all things, according to his own unchangable Will; His <hi>Coun≈øels of old,</hi> that are Faithfulne≈øs and Truth, are remon≈øtrated to him by the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ≈øervent de≈øires of his ≈øervants, that knew them to be his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels, and who are ordered by the ≈øame coun≈øels to enquire, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeech him by prayer according to them, and therefore by his <hi>≈øpirit, the ≈øpirit of prayer,</hi> He draws the parallel lines to his own Intentions upon their Hearts, De≈øires, and Affections.</p>
                  <p>I have pur≈øued this the further, becau≈øe it gives a ≈øolution to that Doubt, how God without any change in him≈øelf hears pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and al≈øo a≈ø≈øures us, this prayer being ≈øo remarkable, as to be twice us'd in the ≈øame words, mo≈øt certainly bears it ≈øelf upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65165:87"/> ≈øome certain principle, from which we may argue to general practi≈øe. The principle it re≈øts upon, mu≈øt be this: There is an E≈øtabli≈øh'd order betwixt <hi>the wrath</hi> and <hi>di≈øplea≈øure</hi> of God; <hi>His Fury,</hi> and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> and <hi>the Nations,</hi> or <hi>Families, not knowing, not calling on his Name:</hi> and this is known by very light of Nature. <hi>His Wrath,</hi> according to unchangable Laws, is always <hi>prepar'd</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt tho≈øe that for≈øake him, and that Duty they owe to him, as Nations: It had been el≈øe a great pre≈øumption upon God, and Breach of Charity to the Nations ≈øo to pray again≈øt them; which may al≈øo give us account of all tho≈øe Dreadful Imprecations, and Cur≈øes, <hi>David,</hi> and other <hi>Prophets</hi> and Holy men pour out again≈øt their own Enemies, and the Enemies of their people; They are founded in their being Enemies to God, his True Wor≈øhip, Love, and Service, and as ≈øuch their Final De≈øtruction was decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them by the mo≈øt Righteous Laws of Divine Government, made known unto tho≈øe Holy men, and ≈øo they prayed for it as publique per≈øons, and not out of private Wrath and Revenge: but this by the way. I proceed now in the main Argument.</p>
                  <p>And this principle I am upon, That the Wrath of God is again≈øt the <hi>Nations</hi> that are without <hi>National Religion,</hi> lyes deeper in a Fir≈øt, and more Original principle, <hi>viz.</hi> There is an Obligation, a great Duty lying upon <hi>Nations,</hi> as <hi>Nations to know, and wor≈øhip the True God;</hi> For el≈øe <hi>why ≈øhould God find fault? why ≈øhould he be angry, when none had re≈øi≈øted his Will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it is, That there is a Natural Order e≈øtabli≈øhed by God, between his Love, and Favour, and a People, and their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique True Religion, becau≈øe it is the Ob≈øervation of a Duty, and the Ob≈øervation of Duty is the fitting us for Ble≈ø≈øing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>avour, as the neglect, and Tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion of Duty cannot be without wrath and di≈øplea≈øure. For thus God hath placed <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> one over again≈øt another; yet ≈øo that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Ble≈ø≈øing</hi> are always fir≈øt, even as Duty is always before ≈øin: For God <hi>never made Death and De≈øtruction,</hi> even as he never could be the cau≈øe of ≈øin, but they come in by the Failing of our Duty, and ≈øo of that Life and Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs entail'd on our Duty.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Obligation to National True Religion is much more evident from the≈øe Holy men, praying down Wrath upon them that <hi>know not God,</hi> and that <hi>call not on his Name;</hi> then it could have been from the praying for his Favour to them, that <hi>did know him,</hi> and that did <hi>call on his Name;</hi> becau≈øe his Favour might
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65165:87"/> have been vouch≈øafed upon Terms much below our ≈øub≈øtantial and inviolable Duty: As many of the <hi>Jewi≈øh Rites</hi> might be Arguments for, and Pledges of Gods gracious Regard to the people, he had ≈øo di≈øtingui≈øh'd, when the want of tho≈øe ≈øigns would not have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to the effu≈øion of his Wrath and Vengeance, there being no natural, or po≈øitive Duty lying upon any, but the <hi>Jews</hi> to ≈øuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervances: There may be many Arguments for the Bounty and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God from External Rites appointed by him, and ob≈øerv'd by his people; though indeed the≈øe all refer to their E≈ø≈øential Duty, and argue nothing without it: Yet the contrary will not enforce to the oppo≈øite Degrees of Wrath and Indignation, becau≈øe they are not ob≈øerv'd, when no ≈øub≈øtantial Duty is violated. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion, that keeps the Law,</hi> may have in the main the ≈øame ≈øecurity from wrath, with <hi>Circumci≈øion that keeps the Law al≈øo.</hi> Seeing then there is ≈øo great wrath again≈øt tho≈øe <hi>that know not God, that call not on his Name;</hi> It a≈ø≈øures us, the Duty, the Obligation, and the Rea≈øon of it lye deep, that the omi≈ø≈øion is ≈øo ≈øubjected to the Divine Revenges: and it is in this; A ≈øociety without Religion is a High contempt of God, <hi>a making fle≈øh our arm,</hi> and departing from the Lord, and ≈øo from his Favour and Ble≈ø≈øing. A princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality without an In≈øcription, a Dedication to the Glory of God, to which all things are to be devoted, is like the building <hi>a Tower up to Heaven.</hi> A ≈øin like the ≈øin of <hi>Herod,</hi> when he let that Sacrilegious Applau≈øe ≈øink into him, and gave not <hi>the Glory to God,</hi> and therefore ≈øubjects men to be at any time ≈ømitten and bla≈øted by God; who has ≈øaid, <hi>Tho≈øe that honour him, he will honour; but all el≈øe ≈øhall be lightly e≈øteem'd,</hi> whether <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>Per≈øon.</hi> It is not therefore only the Judgment upon the Irreligion of particular per≈øons, of particular Families, that is here intended, though this is included and ≈øuppos'd, but e≈øpecially upon the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Societies, knitting and ≈øtrengthning them≈øelves without the True God; upon Principalities exalting them≈øelves, and not by and with the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and <hi>Supreme Maje≈øty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide, if there be a Duty, an Obligation of being publiquely Religious, there is a Ble≈ø≈øing upon it, according to that Fundamental Principle; <hi>He that cometh to God, mu≈øt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ≈øeek him: that Godline≈øs hath the promi≈øes of this life, and of that which is to come:</hi> And this mu≈øt be fir≈øt, becau≈øe as Righteou≈øne≈øs and Duty are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øin, ≈øo Ble≈ø≈øing and Favour are before Wrath and Di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65165:88"/> Yet Wrath is a more certain Demon≈øtration of ab≈øolute Duty violated, than Favour is of ab≈øolute Duty ob≈øerv'd, becau≈øe the Favour of God is more at liberty than his Wrath, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways depends on ≈øtrict Ju≈øtice. All which amounts to the full proof of the great Duty of <hi>National Religion</hi> from this prayer, ≈øeeing National Irreligion is <hi>≈øo near the Cur≈øe of Divine Fury and Revenge.</hi>

                  <p>Having thus far con≈øidered National Religion, as it is founded <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> in the very Laws of Nature, and inviolable duty to God. I come ≈øecondly, to con≈øider the Wi≈ødom, and unque≈øtionable Rationality of the Divine Ordination <hi>among the Jews;</hi> when by a Prerogative of Power, and Goodne≈øs, God would ≈øecure the True Religion, after <hi>the Nations</hi> had ≈øo corrupted them≈øelves, and that he had now begun, as the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> ≈øpeaks, <hi>to ≈øuffer them to walk after their own ways:</hi> He founds his Wor≈øhip, as it were anew, fir≈øt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and from thence commences it into a National State, even as he did the Family, wherein he had plac'd it, and that for the very ≈øake of his True Wor≈øhip, which <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> had indeed many peculiars in its Religious Con≈øtitution, ≈øuch as are not to be found in any other, as I ≈øhall after account for them; yet in the general, it is an Evidence of the Fitne≈øs and Agreeablene≈øs of that Model of Humane Society, to the Ends of Religion, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptablene≈øs to God, it ≈øhould be ≈øo devoted.</p>
                  <p>But becau≈øe we may think this chu≈øing of <hi>Abrahams Family,</hi> and the <hi>Nation</hi> ri≈øing from it, was an Interdict upon any other <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> to in≈øtitute a publique National Religion, any other ways, than as they <hi>Pro≈øelyted</hi> them≈øelves to that one Nation and Family: It is very ob≈øervable, there are el≈øewhere the foot≈øteps of <hi>National,</hi> and <hi>Family Religion,</hi> though more rare in that very time, as in <hi>Melchi≈øedeck,</hi> who was <hi>King of Salem, of Peace and Righteou≈øne≈øs,</hi> and <hi>Prie≈øt of the mo≈øt High God,</hi> ≈øo incorporating Religion with his Government, the ≈øame is to be found in <hi>Job,</hi> and his Friends: ≈øo that the Erecting a <hi>National Religion</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> did not ≈øuper≈øede the obligation of any of the <hi>Nations</hi> to the <hi>National Wor≈øhip</hi> of God, though in Judgment pa≈øt our finding out, He <hi>≈øo overlook'd them, as to leave them to them≈øelves, for he never left him≈øelf without witne≈øs</hi> He ought to be ≈øo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipped, by <hi>giving them fruitful times and ≈øea≈øons, and filling their hearts with food and gladne≈øs: He was never far from them, in</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. When God gave the great in≈øtance and pattern of <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion,</hi> e≈øpecially as in a <hi>National Church;</hi> how much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe did he found it, than is po≈ø≈øible to be derived from our Saviours In≈øtitution. He begun it in a holy Root, that ≈øprouted out and grew, and flouri≈øhed into a Nation <hi>holy to God.</hi> By his appointment they met together at <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> in the <hi>≈øolemn Fea≈øts</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as <hi>publique Ordinances.</hi> The <hi>Prie≈øts,</hi> and more e≈øpecially the <hi>High-Prie≈øts,</hi> were in mo≈øt Authorirative Deputation from God, between him, and that peculiar people, that they might unite all as in <hi>One.</hi> The <hi>Temple, Altar</hi> and <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> were as the common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the publique wor≈øhip; and a great ≈øin it was to have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied any of the≈øe, and ≈øo to have made a Divi≈øion.</p>
                  <p>They had <hi>Prophets,</hi> who were their extraordinary <hi>National Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters,</hi> their Office and Sermons clo≈øely relating to the general ≈øtate. La≈øtly, their <hi>Civil Magi≈øtrates</hi> were under the ≈øtricte≈øt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, to attemper their Government and Admini≈øtrations to the Religious Laws, given by God to that people.</p>
                  <p>Be≈øides all this, they had the <hi>Levites</hi> di≈øper≈øed through their Cities and Villages, to teach, and in≈øtruct in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> the places wherein they a≈ø≈øembled for con≈øtant exerci≈øes of Religion. But now what a ≈øilence is there of all the≈øe things, or any thing like them, with relation to Nations in our Lords appointment? His <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> called men out of <hi>Judai≈øm,</hi> or <hi>Heatheni≈øm,</hi> the then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Nations, into private and particular A≈ø≈øemblies, called Churches, under Pa≈øtors particular to them, without any Rules for Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrates, or expectation of ≈øervice from them; which argues, he did not intend <hi>National Churches;</hi> or if he did by the <hi>Prophets</hi> ≈øignifie any ≈øuch, it was not intended they ≈øhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65165:97"/> be in this dark and cloudy ≈øtate, wherein <hi>Antichri≈øtiani≈øm</hi> has ≈øo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; it is re≈øerv'd for ≈øome more glorious State of the Church, ≈øome more eminent appearance of Chri≈øt, wherein ≈øuch <hi>Prophecies</hi> are to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it came to pa≈øs, the only In≈øtances we have in Scripture, of Chri≈øtian Societies, the di≈øcour≈øes of them, the Rules in relation to them, are all fitted to private and particular Congregations; and where there are any ≈øuch ≈øpoken of, they are called Churches or Congregations; ≈øo that there is no A≈ø≈øociation in Chri≈øtian Religion mentioned, but under the name of a Church, to ≈øignifie Chri≈øtian Religious Societies, and Churches, are all one; ≈øo that there can be no National Chri≈øtian Religion, without a National Church: But there is no rule either of a National Chri≈øtian Religion in the New Te≈øtament, or a National Church.</p>

                  <p>To give fir≈øt an an≈øwer to the≈øe Objections together: The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments already mentioned do mightily prevail with me that it is impo≈ø≈øible Chri≈øtianity ≈øhould by any of its influences, ≈øo much as ≈øu≈øpend ≈øo ab≈øolute a Natural Duty upon mankind as this, <hi>viz.</hi> to con≈øecrate National A≈ø≈øociations to God in National Religion, but that it is always the duty of Chri≈øtian Magi≈øtrates and people to unite in National Chri≈øtian Religion; Or that the Redeemer of mankind ≈øhould cut off ≈øo great a priviledg of Nations as that, to intitle them≈øelves <hi>Nationally</hi> to God, and his favour and ble≈ø≈øing, and to make profe≈ø≈øion of the wi≈øe≈øt and only true Religion in the world; or that the very proper and natural Glory of Chri≈øtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>to make di≈øciples of all Nations,</hi> may not at all times be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by every particular Nation. However the <hi>Prophecies</hi> may be more literally fulfilled hereafter in the purity and univer≈øality of Chri≈øtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>This being premi≈øed, I come more particularly to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer.</p>

                  <p>Now the Rea≈øon why our <hi>Saviour</hi> pitches upon ≈øo ≈ømall a number of <hi>Chri≈øtians, agreeing,</hi> is certainly this, becau≈øe he would appoint no other form to his Church, than ≈øuch as could live, as could ≈øub≈øi≈øt under any Civil Government whatever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friendly or unfriendly to it. He gave it no other ≈øhape, but what it might attain and keep under any ≈øtate of Civil Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any enmity it met with in the world.</p>
                  <p>And this was mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe the Church of Chri≈øt was not confin'd to one Nation, as the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> was, whom God in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner ≈øingled out, and manag'd to the ≈øtate of a Kingdom, and Nation, by a mighty power, and out-≈øtretched arm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerv'd by the ≈øame, ruling it with an immediate ≈øen≈øible pre≈øence, after he had form'd it by preci≈øe Laws, and ≈øetled the ju≈øt bounds of all Officers in their Office, and appointed them the place of the exerci≈øe of it; whereas the Chri≈øtian Doctrine being indifferent to every Nation under Heaven, it did, as it made its progre≈øs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert certain numbers to it ≈øelf at fir≈øt, which had no priviledg of humane Laws or Powers, but the edg of all turn'd again≈øt it; ≈øo that the Form of Churches was compo≈øed to all the vici≈ø≈øitudes of Providence they were to undergo; and that in all rea≈øon, mu≈øt be in ca≈øe of nece≈ø≈øity, the very lea≈øt of Societies of Chri≈øtians, <hi>Two, or Two or Three</hi> (as our Saviour ≈øignificantly points upon ≈ømall Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties) for ≈øuch are mo≈øt fitted to the wor≈øt of conditions that could befall; le≈ø≈øer, and ≈øingle bodies moving every way, and ≈øhifting for the gaining opportunities for the a≈ø≈øembling them≈øelves, and pre≈øerving their relation one to another, in the di≈øcharge of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duties, much more ea≈øily than any greater a≈ø≈øociations could; for our Saviour intended all for u≈øe, not for Form; he minded not <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, Titular Bi≈øhops</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far I have pleaded the appointment of Chri≈øt, that the ≈ømalle≈øt numbers of Chri≈øtians may agree and a≈ø≈øociate, and be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured of his pre≈øence.</p>
                  <p>But now, that this appointment is in bar of greater Societies of Chri≈øtians, is by no means to be granted; for it is mo≈øt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, our Saviour de≈øign'd all things under the Go≈øplel ≈øhould be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65165:99"/> re≈øtor'd to the Law of Nature, and the true Rea≈øon of Things.</p>
                  <p>Now according to that, the fir≈øt End of all Society, is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of True Religion, in more than ≈øolitude.</p>
                  <p>This de≈øire of enjoying true Religion in Society, extends it ≈øelf from the lea≈øt of Societies, to the greate≈øt, that are not too great for the Ends of Society: Our Saviour therefore, as he gave no Frame of po≈øitive Laws, or Wor≈øhip, no <hi>Pedagogy</hi> of Precepts, ≈øo no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution of Bounding Churches, but that in ca≈øe of ≈øtraits and exigencies his true Religion may be admini≈øtred in the very ≈ømalle≈øt of Societies with confidence of his Favour and Pre≈øence; when it hath freedom, it may enlarge it ≈øelf further and further; and if it have favour of Nations and Governments, a≈øcend to the greate≈øt; yet with this re≈øerve, That if in any time or place National Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity varies from the true Original Chri≈øtianity, as often it hath been ≈øound to do; ≈øo that it cannot, even in ≈øub≈øtantial things, be con≈øented in with a pure Con≈øcience, privater Congregations, even to the mo≈øt particular, are always ready for Chri≈øtians to retire into; for ≈øo the Laws of Nature allow, where the Publick is not ≈øafe; and yet when the whole is not corrupted, nor liberty of joyning without commixture with tho≈øe Corruptions denied, there may yet be, there ought to be no Separation.</p>
                  <p>Thus the greate≈øt Societies are not in bar of the lea≈øt, when True Religion requires them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the lea≈øt are not in bar of the greate≈øt, when Chri≈øtianity is at full freedom; for it is clo≈øely allied with that <hi>Wi≈ødom, whereby Kings ought to Reign, and Princes to decree Ju≈øtice; by which Princes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>ought to rule, and Nobles, yea all the Judges of the Earth, with that Wi≈ødom, which rejoyces in the Habitable parts of the Earth, and hath its delights with the ≈øons of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have therefore before ob≈øerved, That Chri≈øtian Religion at the very fir≈øt joyn'd it ≈øelf, as near as it could, to all Humane Societies made ready to it, as Families, Villages, Regions; and ≈øo far as the Rage of Per≈øecution would permit Chri≈øtian Societies, united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves unto Di≈øtant and National Corre≈øpondencies among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</p>
                  <p>Now it hath been ≈øo unhappy indeed with the World, that in few In≈øtances there hath been a Good State of National Religion to yield a full, con≈øciencious Compliance with. Yet this will no more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue again≈øt the Thing it ≈øelf, than it does again≈øt any other of the wi≈øe and good Ordinations of God, or again≈øt the <hi>Jewi≈øh Church,</hi>

                  <p>If Corruption would argue again≈øt any good Appointment, or Ordination of God, it would argue again≈øt <hi>Churches</hi> of the very <hi>fir≈øt Form,</hi> or <hi>Con≈øtitution;</hi> tho≈øe <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> who≈øe Corruption is ≈øeverely tax'd and threatned, yet are without any Cen≈øure as to their Con≈øtitution; and while S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>From whence I conclude, no Form of Churches can recommend things di≈øagreeing from the word of God, how truly form'd ≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tho≈øe <hi>Churches</hi> be; for Churches are con≈øtituted for joyning in tho≈øe things that are agreeable to the Will of Chri≈øt, not in tho≈øe that are not; and yet Separation from Corruptions does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øitate Separation from <hi>Churches,</hi> while there are any Parts of Divine Truth and Wor≈øhip pre≈øerv'd pure to unite in; ≈øo great are the Obligations that lye upon all ≈øincerely Religious, to make true Religion as publick as they can in the ≈øeveral Societies that are found to ingraft it upon.</p>

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>National Religion, and National Union in it, is as <hi>a city ≈øet upon an Hill, that cannot be hid;</hi> as a candle ≈øet upon ≈øo exalted a candle≈øtick, that gives light to all within it ≈øelf, and about it, even as far as the Fame of that Nation reaches.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Churches,</hi> much more, as ri≈øing up into a National State, are <hi>the Glory of Chri≈øt:</hi> As therefore, though we may be in ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard more exact in the mo≈øt private, we go out of our Per≈øonal Religion into Family Religion, out of our Family Religion into Congregational, and as the Chri≈øtians at fir≈øt (mo≈øt probably) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of Humane Society, went out of Congregations, into Con≈øociation of Churches in Religion; ≈øo we out of all the≈øe where National Union in true Religion allows it go into that Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al State, that we may build the honour of Religion to the highe≈øt, in ≈øo ≈øen≈øible and under≈øtanding a Con≈øent and Union in it, ≈øo publick an acknowledgment of God; and though hereby it be as a <hi>Net</hi> that draws in <hi>bad as well as good,</hi> even vi≈øibly and apparently; yet when we con≈øider the po≈ø≈øible care again≈øt it in particular Congregations, though ≈øtill National, when we further con≈øider the ≈øtate of the <hi>Jewi≈øh Church,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the ≈øtate of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyptick Churches,</hi> the doubt will not be ≈øo cogent, as to move National Religion out of the Nature of things.</p>
                  <p>The only remaining Doubt is, that thus National Magi≈øtracy becomes as the Head of ≈øuch a Religion, the National Religion is gathered and united in the Magi≈øtrate and his Laws, and that which ≈øhould only be united in, and depend upon the Laws of Chri≈øt, becomes ≈øubject to another Head; on pretence of which Magi≈øtrates have been attempted on too with force to bring their power to true Religion.</p>
                  <p>The An≈øwer I give to this ≈øhall be very brief, in three Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I always own any pretence taken from exalting <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to enforce Civil Powers, to ratifie true≈øt Religion into National Con≈øti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Where there is National Religion, even the National Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is fir≈øt Chri≈øtianiz'd; ≈øo that there is no Head≈øhip, no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but Chri≈øt and his Laws taking place upon a National State in profe≈ø≈øion of him.

                  <p n="3">3. All Union in True Religion is free, rational, voluntary.

That in Circum≈øtantials of Religion, what is prepared and ≈øetled, ≈øo that it cannot be alter'd by any private di≈øpo≈øe, nor allowed to any private choice, without ≈øcandal to the publick; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ≈øhould con≈øider his <hi>Liberty of Con≈øcience</hi> on one ≈øide, as on the other, to pre≈øerve him≈øelf from ≈øcruple, as in the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> in≈øtance of <hi>eating;</hi> There is liberty on one ≈øide to <hi>eat all things,</hi> but this does not determine to a nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>eating;</hi> that were not liberty: If therefore there be a good rea≈øon, an expediency <hi>not to eat,</hi> the liberty is more con≈øerv'd in <hi>not eating</hi> than in <hi>eating:</hi> So it is in the u≈øe, or not u≈øe of all indifferent things. Where then (as to the ca≈øe we are now upon) the advantages for publique Religion incline this way, or that way, to the u≈øe, or not u≈øe of Indifferent Things, It is our greate≈øt liberty, to move our ≈øelves that way, and not to be deterr'd with the ≈øu≈øpition of the lo≈øs of it by ≈øo doing.</p>
                  <p>This ≈øeems to be the <hi>Prophet Zachariahs</hi> re≈øolution, concerning the <hi>Fa≈øts,</hi> wherein tho≈øe that would have them laid down, and others would keep them ≈øtill a foot differ'd.

For though outward Forms, Uniformity, or Variety in them, are of no account in them≈øelves with God, but either way in the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or the Variety; <hi>They that ≈øerve God in ≈øpirit and truth,</hi> are accepted of him; yet the angry di≈ø≈øents and di≈øagreements that di≈ø-joyn the minds of men, and di≈øable the Union of Divine Wor≈øhip, is like <hi>the covering the Altar with tears of complaint,</hi> and <hi>makes the offering unacceptable.</hi> That there may be the Unity God is delighted in, without Uniformity, is plain by the <hi>Harmony of the Evangeli≈øts,</hi> in their <hi>Hi≈øtory</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> where there is perfect Unity, yet without Uniformity; it is plain too by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration of Gods <hi>≈ømelling a ≈øavour of re≈øt in the ≈øervices of the Church</hi> Univer≈øal, where there is great Variety, yet Unity. But the contentions and quarrels that often ari≈øe about the≈øe things, are the great cau≈øes of Gods di≈øplea≈øure; what may mo≈øt cure them, is then mo≈øt to be de≈øired and cho≈øen; but what that is, I will not be ≈øo bold as to pre≈øcribe, whether a ≈øtrict Conformity, upon Rea≈øons in Government, be≈øt under≈øtood by Governours them≈øelves, or a compa≈ø≈øionate Indulgence mo≈øt acceptable to Chri≈øtianity.</p>

                     <hi>Rule</hi> 5. We ought to have a ≈øteady, and certain Gage within our ≈øelves, of what <hi>our Lord</hi> hath provided for the pre≈øerving the truth of Religion to us, and what care he hath taken ≈øo far, as is po≈ø≈øible, with the con≈øervation of that Truth to give us all advantage for publickne≈øs in Religion.</p>
                  <p>As to the truth of Religion, the≈øe three provi≈øions will ≈øecure it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no man is ≈øo much bound to any Church, Communion, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Government, as to the true Religion, which is the fir≈øt, and ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øary; nor ≈øhall his withdrawing from any of them in things impure and offen≈øive to God, be charged upon him as ≈øin or Schi≈øm: All the <hi>putting out of Synagogues, ca≈øting out Names,</hi> or <hi>Excommunications,</hi> ≈øignifie not any thing where <hi>God</hi> and Chri≈øt are in <hi>communion;</hi> and where tho≈øe on whom they fall are of the <hi>general A≈ø≈øembly,</hi> and <hi>Church of the Fir≈øt born,</hi> of that truly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> which is the only <hi>nece≈ø≈øary Church</hi> to be of, <hi>that we may be ≈øaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The private≈øt A≈ø≈øemblies, yea even ≈øingle Souls, ≈øo retiring that they may wor≈øhip God according to his word, have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe that God and Chri≈øt <hi>will make their abode with them, come and ≈øup with them and they with him, and they ≈øhall be written in the writing of Gods people:</hi> The Catholick Church is always provided for them, that they may not be out of the be≈øt Society under Heaven. The

This honour have all the Saints of Chri≈øt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the evils that can be endured upon account of Chri≈øt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, will be abundantly recompenced by the ≈øaving of the ≈øoul, and that better and truer life. That Argument of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>He that lo≈øes his life ≈øaves it, and he that ≈øaves it lo≈øes it: And what ≈øhall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lo≈øes his own ≈øoul? or what ≈øhall he give in exchange for his ≈øoul?</hi> ≈øtands always <hi>impregnable, that a man ≈øhould buy the truth, and not ≈øell it at any rate whatever.</hi> Thus for the Truth of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the Publickne≈øs of Religion, there are the≈øe great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chri≈øtian Religion profe≈ø≈øes Love, endeavour of Good, and Salvation to all men, to every Creature, and hath antiquated all that <hi>Judai≈øm,</hi> that neglects any for their <hi>profit to Salvation,</hi> though but Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That a man may join his Religious Services to any thing truly good in Natural or Revealed Religion, whether of Families, Neighbourhoods, Cities, Nations, or of voluntary Societies, ≈øtopping there, and keeping him≈øelf free from other mens ≈øins, ≈øo that the evil that other men adjoin to any thing true and good in Religion, being prote≈øted again≈øt, and divided from, does not corrupt what is good or true, but it may be enjoyed in the mo≈øt publick way, while we have nothing to do with the evil, nor find it ≈øo mixt with the good, as to admit of no ≈øeparation. And what is wanting in the publick wor≈øhip of that which Chri≈øt hath ordained and commanded, does not nece≈ø≈øitate the total departure from that publick Wor≈øhip, when the very In≈øtitution is not chang'd by that want; for the true Chri≈øtian may make up that want in privater Duties: Thus they <hi>that feared the Lord, ≈øpake often to</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. There is a free u≈øe granted by Chri≈øt of all things indifferent, or a freedom on each ≈øides to do, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And this con≈øideration may ≈øtate to us the whole matter, that relates to order and decency.</p>

                  <p>That order which is the prudential contrivance of men, though not the ≈øame in all places, times, and to all per≈øons (as the former) yet ought to be chearfully complied with, as what is nece≈ø≈øary to a National union in, and admini≈øtration of publick Religion, both as to Officers and Things, ≈øeeing nothing can be ≈øetled without order.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly we find the wi≈øe and pious Governours among the <hi>Jews</hi> taking care and the people ≈øubmitting to ≈øuch Ordinations, and all under Divine Approbation.</p>
                  <p>The Order that is meerly of Humane po≈øition, and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moves the greate≈øt doubt, ≈øtanding in things that have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thin pretexts of Antiquity to give them ≈øome venerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, or that they are u≈øages already in being, or that they add the Imaginary decency, that Ceremonies ≈øet out Humane actions with. Now as to this they that have the power of impo≈øing, are equally to weigh the value of Religion it ≈øelf, and what that may ≈øuffer for the ≈øake of this order, and a great account lyes upon them before God; but for tho≈øe that are under ≈øubjection, I add further,</p>
                  <p>As to this ≈øort of order, I can only ≈øay this, that ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing it no way turn'd into <hi>Doctrine</hi> (as the <hi>Phari≈øees not eating with unwa≈øhen hands)</hi> but declar'd again≈øt as ≈øuch, the con≈øequences of ob≈øerving, or not ob≈øerving, are to be ballanc'd, and ≈øo the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti≈øe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65165:108"/> of every con≈øcientious man to be determined.</p>
                  <p>On one ≈øide ≈øtands the freedom of u≈øing this order, as an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to do good, the con≈øideration of the peace of Nations, the National defence made more unite again≈øt fal≈øe Religion at the price of Conformity to tho≈øe more Arbitrary Impo≈øitions.</p>
                  <p>On the other ≈øide ≈øtands a ju≈øt fear for the purity of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either ob≈øcured, or the freedom of it incumbered; or for the reputation of Religion, which often ≈øuffers by tho≈øe unnece≈ø≈øary adherencies, as if they entered into the nature of Religion it ≈øelf.</p>
                  <p>I mu≈øt yet allow the preference, in my own judgment, to that ≈øide by which National Religion is mo≈øt ≈øerved; but with the full per≈øwa≈øion, that God receives both, if over-bitter zeal on either ≈øide be not offen≈øive to him; and with the conce≈ø≈øion, that National Religion were more happy, if more free; but if love adju≈øt to each their due allowance, the ≈øervices of both will be found with great acceptance in the common National Religion, as I doubt not their hands would be in the defence of it again≈øt the <hi>Inva≈øion</hi> of a <hi>National fal≈øe Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if any be over-rigid, or ≈øevere on either part, they may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the <hi>full rewards</hi> of their own ≈øociety, or party, but they le≈ø≈øen the higher recompences of doing the mo≈øt publique good.

                  <p>Thus Chri≈øtianity was made as publique in all places, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles, as they could, by adjoyning it to any principle of Truth, or to the natural ≈øen≈øe of Religion, they found any where; St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave ≈øolemn thanks to God in the mid≈øt of all that ≈øailed with him, though a bad ≈øort of men.

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THAT which I will endeavour in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the following Di≈øcour≈øe, be to pre≈øent my De≈øign and Method in ≈øtating the Nature of <hi>Scandal,</hi> that it may be more intelligible by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øeen fir≈øt, as in a Land≈øcape, in this Entry; and then to add ≈øome Con≈øiderations of great ≈øtrength to each part of that Undertaking, that have ≈øince arrived to my Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>As to the Method, I mu≈øt in my own defence ≈øay, that I have to do with a Subject, in which ≈øo much of the <hi>deceitfulne≈øs of Sin</hi> is trea≈øured up, of ≈øo moveable a con≈øideration, (as Scripture from its own various ≈øhapes offers it to us) that
<pb facs="tcp:65165:114"/> it cannot ea≈øily be known, or trac'd: I hope therefore it will be allowed as ≈øome part of an <hi>Apology,</hi> that the Thread of my Treating concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, does not run ≈øo even, and ≈øtreight along, as it ought.</p>
                  <p>Further, I mu≈øt take Sanctuary at the Reader's Candor, for the acceptance of my ≈øincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and any degree of performance in ≈øo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a task: I confe≈øs the want of the mo≈øt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Arts of Method, and a clear unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Style: Yet that I might take the true≈øt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure of ≈øo multiform and vague a Notion;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I have taken hold of it in the mo≈øt ≈øtrict and preci≈øe De≈øcription I could frame, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all ca≈øes of Sin, therein re≈øting e≈øpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon tho≈øe words Scripture u≈øes to convey the ≈øentiments of it to us. Thus <hi>Scandal</hi> is that by which we are drawn into any ≈øin, and off from the cour≈øe of Duty, and Religious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ≈øo intangled in Guilt, di≈øea≈øe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, and indangered as to Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, under a pretext of Rea≈øon or Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becau≈øe <hi>I</hi> find the Scripture applies the Notion of <hi>Scandal</hi> e≈øpecially, when ≈øome of the grand Principles and Laws of Religion are violated under ≈øuch pretext; I have con≈øidered
<pb facs="tcp:65165:114"/> it, as referred to tho≈øe great Principles by ≈øuch ≈øacred u≈øe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe there is a very peculiar, and mo≈øt remarkable u≈øe of it, in the ca≈øe of <hi>indifferent</hi> Things, by the <hi>Apo≈øtle,</hi> when they are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ≈øin, by being determined upon in practice with a <hi>doubting Con≈øcience</hi> (be≈øides other ways, wherein being u≈øed ami≈øs, they may become <hi>Scandals,</hi> or occa≈øions of it) I have therefore allowed a very peculiar Head of Di≈øcour≈øe to that Ca≈øe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becau≈øe by deeply con≈øidering <hi>Scandal,</hi> and that, as our Saviour pronounces, <hi>Scandals mu≈øt needs come,</hi> I found there mu≈øt be ≈øome <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, Fundamental,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øal Scandal,</hi> that covers the whole State of Sin in general; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre≈ø≈øed the la≈øt part of my Meditation on the Nature of <hi>Scandal,</hi> to this <hi>Primitive, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And la≈øtly, I re≈øume upon the whole, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation of <hi>Scandal</hi> adju≈øted to what I found upon each of tho≈øe forementioned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after it.</p>
                  <p>And herein I hope I may have hung up Lights to di≈øcover in ≈øome degree, and to avoid ≈øo dark and my≈øterious an Evil, as <hi>Scandal,</hi> though
<pb facs="tcp:65165:115"/> I have not been able to do it to tho≈øe degrees I de≈øired, or to compo≈øe into ≈øo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an Order, or ≈øo per≈øpicuous an Expre≈ø≈øion, what I had my ≈øelf clearer apprehen≈øions of. Thus far as to the Method.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ≈øtrengthening ≈øome parts of this di≈øcour≈øe by Con≈øiderations that have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to my Thoughts, ≈øince I had ≈øet an end to the Treati≈øe it ≈øelf; they have ari≈øen from the clo≈øe ob≈øervation of the Contexture of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Sermon upon <hi>Scandal,</hi> as it is Recorded e≈øpecially in this <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 17. Compared with the Debates of the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Corinths,</hi> which are the mo≈øt eminent Seats of the Doctrin of <hi>Scandal,</hi> we have in all the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour therefore, who≈øe chief bu≈øine≈øs into the World, was his recovery of it from <hi>Scandal,</hi> the Deception, and the Ruin of it, by giving ≈øatisfaction to the Divine Glory, for the di≈øhonour done to it by <hi>Scandal,</hi> hath ble≈ø≈øed us with as Soveraign Arguments and In≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons again≈øt either giving or receiving it.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord hath ≈øo embraced all ≈øorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Scandal</hi> within this Sermon, that none can be exempted from the force and energy of

                     </gap>t, that they have a particular poignancy again≈øt <hi>Scandals</hi> within his <hi>Church,</hi> and one more particular kind, given by a particular ≈øort of Men, and directed again≈øt another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ≈øort of Men, will be mo≈øt evident from the ≈øurvey I am now to give of his <hi>Heaven-born Di≈øcour≈øe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The occa≈øion of it was the Di≈øciples coming ≈øolemnly to him with a grand Quere, in which no doubt their Ambition, a very ignorant Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, was deeply concerned. <hi>Who,</hi> ≈øay they, <hi>is the greate≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> That is, as was generally under≈øtood at that time, in the <hi>Kingdom of the Me≈ø≈øiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord, as he was wont on all ≈øuch Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, takes the occa≈øion of mo≈øt Grave, Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Important Doctrine, and Admonition in return to it.</p>
                  <p>And that he might place in his Remon≈øtrance a mo≈øt lively Emblem; He calls a <hi>little Child,</hi> and <hi>≈øets him in the mid≈øt of the Di≈øciples:</hi> and upon him di≈øplays the≈øe two great points of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That except a <hi>man be converted, and become as a little Child, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> either of Chri≈øt here in the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:65165:116"/> his <hi>True Church,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Now though this being <hi>Converted,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming as <hi>little Children,</hi> be very profitably, and pertinently applyed to Regeneration; yet, con≈øidering it in the Scope, and whole Context, it is very evidently de≈øigned to that Humility, Unimperiou≈øne≈øs, ≈øen≈øe of the danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing for ever; Innocency, and Inoffen≈øive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs from <hi>Scandal,</hi> by which others peri≈øh: The re≈øemblances of which are found no where in this World ≈øo agreeable and ≈øignificant, as in ≈øome Properties of <hi>little Children,</hi> and their Nature; the manly ≈øtate of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ≈øhewing ≈øo little hereof in this great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, as to require a perfect <hi>Conver≈øion,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> to ≈øuch a ≈øtate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ≈øecond point of Truth is this, That whoever <hi>humbles him≈øelf,</hi> and becomes as ≈øuch a <hi>little Child,</hi> in tho≈øe Chri≈øtian Properties, is one of tho≈øe <hi>Great ones,</hi> tho≈øe <hi>Magnates;</hi> or the more any one <hi>humbles him≈øelf</hi> ≈øo, the greater he is; and he that <hi>humbles him≈øelf</hi> mo≈øt, is the <hi>greate≈øt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> and ≈øhall be in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65165:116"/>
                  <p> The≈øe two great Points of In≈øtruction being now ≈øettled upon this living Emblem, the <hi>Lord</hi> propo≈øes the very ≈øame to other two as great purpo≈øes of Admonition, although from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a≈øpect or ca≈øt of this one Picture: Con≈øider <hi>Little Ones,</hi> as the Emblems of Weakne≈øs, Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, liablene≈øs to Danger and Injury, of little Defence and Re≈øi≈øtance to any A≈ø≈øault; and ≈øo the <hi>Lord</hi> declares:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whoever <hi>receives</hi> ≈øuch a <hi>little one in his name,</hi> that is, upon the account of Profe≈ø≈øion of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, into a ju≈øt e≈øteem, value, and care, of cheri≈øhing ≈øuch a one in that Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øion, and ≈øecuring him, as far as he can, in the Ble≈ø≈øedne≈øs of that ≈øtate; receives, that is owns and acknowledges with Honour, Chri≈øt him≈øelf, and the kindne≈øs is accepted, as if it were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately placed upon Chri≈øt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if any one <hi>Scandali≈øes,</hi> ≈øets a ≈øtone of <hi>Offence</hi> and Ruin, in the path of ≈øuch a <hi>Little One,</hi> by which he falls from, or in, his Profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øtianity to his De≈øtruction, the <hi>Lord</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces <hi>a Woe</hi> upon ≈øuch a one, as dreadful as the Proverb imports, <hi>It were better that a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtone were hung about his Neck, and he were ca≈øt into the depth of the Sea:</hi> Which as it peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:65165:117"/> dooms the Profe≈ø≈øed, ob≈øtinate <hi>Scandali≈øer,</hi> ≈øo it warns all of managing them≈øelves ≈øo in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtianity, as to ca≈øt off all <hi>Offence</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> from it, and to encourage the tendere≈øt in it, to ≈øtrengthen, and promote them.</p>
                  <p>Hereby then, <hi>our Lord</hi> hath de≈øigned the ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole ≈øtate of Chri≈øtianity from the harm and danger of <hi>Scandal;</hi> for in the≈øe <hi>Little Ones</hi> he comprehends,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Tho≈øe, who in regard of their being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born out of the State of Univer≈øal <hi>Scandal,</hi> are in danger of being re-intangled in its Net, or in regard of any other di≈øadvantage, or liablene≈øs to <hi>Scandals</hi> mi≈øchief, are the <hi>lo≈øt,</hi> as our Saviour after ≈øtiles them, and the weak, though not the young, (as the Apo≈øtle names them.) Now if ≈øuch are ≈øecured, all are ≈øecured: For if a Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans carriage be ≈øo off from the danger of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dali≈øing,</hi> as not to <hi>Scandali≈øe</hi> the <hi>weak,</hi> the ≈øtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will be much le≈øs in danger to be <hi>offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tho≈øe are the <hi>weak,</hi> and the <hi>Little Ones</hi> to us, who appear to us under any ≈øuch di≈øad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, though indeed they are not; as he that <hi>doubts,</hi> and dares not do what others profe≈øs to do on great a≈ø≈øurances, ≈øeems weak to them that <hi>doubt</hi> not, but are ≈øo a≈ø≈øured; and then the
<pb facs="tcp:65165:117"/> Precept of Chri≈øt takes as great hold of us, in all our Admini≈øtrations towards them, as if they were really ≈øo. Now what a Wall of defence were this to Chri≈øtianity! what a happy ≈øtate would the ≈øtate of it be! if we were all mo≈øt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towards tho≈øe, with relation to their ≈øafety for Eternal Happine≈øs, who ≈øeem the lowe≈øt, weake≈øt, lea≈øt to us in that Profe≈ø≈øion?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Term, <hi>Little Ones,</hi> expre≈ø≈øes a ≈øubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation under the <hi>Great Ones:</hi> Now that they may not a≈ø≈øume over the <hi>Little Ones,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> fir≈øt affirms, with his u≈øual A≈ø≈øeveration, that none can be <hi>Great,</hi> or any thing at all in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that is not humble and inoffen≈øive, as a <hi>Little One.</hi> And that if any that takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to be a <hi>Great One,</hi> thinks he has priviledge to do as he plea≈øes, either by Impo≈øition, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periou≈øne≈øs over the <hi>Little Ones,</hi> and does not in all points of Chri≈øtianity, demean him≈øelf as the lea≈øt under one common <hi>Lord,</hi> the Lords dreadful Commination hangs over him, he is in danger to be One of the Grandees in Torments.</p>
                  <p>On tho≈øe things therefore, that lye within the Compare betwixt the <hi>Great Ones</hi> and the <hi>Little Ones,</hi> does the Finger of the Lords Di≈øcour≈øe e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially point.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65165:118"/>

                  <p>And becau≈øe whoever <hi>Scandali≈øes</hi> others, is fir≈øt <hi>Scandali≈øed</hi> him≈øelf, and they al≈øo, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Scandal</hi> from others, have ≈øome great <hi>Scandal</hi> within, upon which that from without catches; he therefore ≈øo ≈øeverely cautions on all ≈øides again≈øt the <hi>Scandal</hi> of the <hi>Right Eye,</hi> the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> the <hi>Right Foot,</hi> and prefers to every mans choice the di≈ømembring any of them, rather than that the whole Body joyned to that Member, ≈øo fettered with <hi>Scandal,</hi> ≈øhould be <hi>ca≈øt into Hell, where their Worm dies not,</hi> and their <hi>Fire is never quenched,</hi> the <hi>dreadful end of Scandal.</hi>

                  <p>Nor is it ≈øaid by the <hi>Apo≈øtle,</hi> they that will not <hi>hear</hi> on ≈øuch accounts, ≈øhould be as <hi>Heathen-men,</hi> or <hi>Publicans,</hi> (or as we ≈øpeak, <hi>Excommunicate)</hi> both which are very notorious in the <hi>Evangeli≈øts Records,</hi> in the Ca≈øe of the <hi>Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes</hi> there ≈øpoken of, which a≈ø≈øures us they are of another Nature.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> urge as from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that what is in the≈øe Ca≈øes <hi>bound on Earth,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65165:120"/> ≈øhall be <hi>bound in Heaven;</hi> or <hi>what is loo≈øed on Earth, ≈øhall be loo≈øed in Heaven;</hi> that there ≈øhall be any obligation on the <hi>doubting Con≈øcience</hi> by the <hi>Churches Canons,</hi> or any ≈øuch di≈øcharge of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God or it ≈øelf by obeying them: But every Man in this Ca≈øe is to <hi>hear</hi> his <hi>own Con≈øcience,</hi> there every thing of this nature is <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>loo≈øed;</hi> there every <hi>word</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> is <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>e≈øtabli≈øhed.</hi>

                  <p>On the other ≈øide, there is no Injunction of <hi>telling the fault</hi> of Non-Conformity, if any be aggrieved at it, in that gradation from <hi>one</hi> to more, and ≈øo to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi>'s command is, Fir≈øt, Not to <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>De≈øpi≈øe,</hi> if that may keep <hi>Indifferents</hi> to their Equipoi≈øe; if not, the Command is, not ≈øo much as by <hi>Example</hi> to <hi>Scandali≈øe,</hi> or draw any that <hi>Doubt</hi> to act again≈øt, or over their <hi>Doubt</hi> in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things, becau≈øe they are but <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;</hi> for that is to <hi>≈øin again≈øt the Brethren,</hi> the <hi>weak Brethren;</hi> as at the lea≈øt we e≈øteem them: Now in the≈øe Ca≈øes, <hi>to ≈øin again≈øt the Brethren, is to ≈øin again≈øt Chri≈øt in his Law again≈øt Scandal.</hi>

But our Lord, with great Compa≈ø≈øion, accepts him ≈øo far as he was come. For, ≈øaith he, <hi>He that is not again≈øt us, is on our part.</hi> He that, although in a different Company, or Mode, does the ≈øame things we do, and does nothing in oppo≈øition to our Great De≈øign, is on <hi>our ≈øide.</hi> And ≈øo he proceeds into a ≈øimilar Di≈øcour≈øe of Kindne≈øs to, or <hi>Scandal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his Di≈øciples, though <hi>Little Ones.</hi> And if we ≈øuppo≈øe it the ≈øame Di≈øcour≈øe as in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and that this <hi>Evangeli≈øt</hi> had not an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate regard to the occa≈øion; yet in that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected it with ≈øuch an occa≈øion, and that by the Divine <hi>Wi≈ødom,</hi> it teaches us how much ≈øuch a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe is adju≈øted to ≈øuch an occa≈øion; for guided by the Holy Spirit, the things are ≈øo laid together.</p>

                  <p>One thing more I cannot but yet adjoin, that the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> is ≈øo wary of Impo≈øing upon any one in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things, appertaining to Religion, in a po≈øitive, or affirmative kind of ob≈øervance, that though for the avoiding <hi>Scandal,</hi> he dehorts from <hi>Eating Meats,</hi> or <hi>drinking Wine,</hi> that may <hi>≈øcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dali≈øe</hi> any in the very Eye of their <hi>Doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience,</hi> and draw them into Sin: yet he no where, to the ≈øame purpo≈øe of avoiding <hi>Scandal,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwades to the e≈øteeming, or ob≈øerving a <hi>Day to the Lord;</hi> though another may be <hi>Scandali≈øed</hi> if he does not ≈øo.

                  <p>Of which <hi>Scandal, our Saviour</hi> was in a deep and inten≈øe Contemplation in this Chapter, and of the ≈øtate of things becau≈øe of it, both in his <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World;</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> e≈øpecially, as it confines upon his <hi>Church,</hi> is in the Neighbourhood of it, and view of what is done in it; or indeed, as within the Armes of it, by a Profe≈ø≈øion of Chri≈øtianity, though an un≈øound and in≈øincere Profe≈ø≈øion; for ≈øo there is the <hi>World</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65165:123"/>
                  <p> The Lord turns him≈øelf to behold and ob≈øerve this <hi>Scandal,</hi> how it di≈øcharges it ≈øelf on all ≈øides with Woe, Mi≈øchief, and Ruine; and with Compa≈ø≈øion foretells and warns all of it, as of the mo≈øt de≈øtructive way of ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the mo≈øt to be abhorred kind of Mi≈øchief and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>This mu≈øt needs make every thinking Chri≈øtian afraid of <hi>Scandal,</hi> of having any thing to do with it, either in giving, or receiving it; and much more of being a Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Pu≈øher of it on in the World, and mo≈øt of all in the <hi>Church.</hi> Now to this whole Di≈øcour≈øe there will be a continual occa≈øion to have recour≈øe in this Treati≈øe: But the words them≈øelves offer to Con≈øideration the≈øe Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the pre≈øent ≈øtate of the World is ≈øuch, that <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals mu≈øt needs come. Scandal</hi> is very pre≈ø≈øing, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in upon the World; in regard of its multitude, its Name is <hi>Legion;</hi> it throngs the World; <hi>our Saviour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øes it in its number, <hi>Scandals:</hi> In regard of its vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, or importunity, it mu≈øt needs be that <hi>Scandal</hi> comes. It thru≈øts in every where, it perverts the be≈øt things, and twines about them; it plays in things Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, how much more in things purely Evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal comes,</hi> it <hi>comes</hi> as an Eagle ha≈øteth to the Prey; it <hi>comes</hi> ≈øupping, and bla≈øting as an Ea≈øt Wind; it <hi>comes</hi> as an Invader with its Troops. And the World, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is it to receive <hi>Scandal?</hi> It calls for, and invites it, it opens all Gates and Doors to it; it even ≈øurrenders and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays it ≈øelf to it; it is mad after <hi>Scandal,</hi> both to give, and receive it: <hi>It mu≈øt needs be</hi> then that <hi>Scandals come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>World</hi> lies under great Mi≈øery, becau≈øe of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propo≈ø.</hi> 2.</note> multitude of <hi>Scandals,</hi> the Efficacy of <hi>Scandal</hi> upon it: It is more mi≈øerable, in regard of <hi>Scandal,</hi> than meerly in regard of Sin. For when <hi>the Lord</hi> Emphatically denounces <hi>a Woe upon the World,</hi> becau≈øe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> he intends ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the Scripture generally declares again≈øt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:123"/> Sin, and Sinners; for that is a known Ca≈øe, that there is a <hi>Woe upon</hi> Sin; <hi>Our Saviour</hi> remon≈øtrates this ca≈øe as more rarely, and yet of all mo≈øt nece≈ø≈øary to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood, ob≈øerved, and profoundly con≈øidered. And though it will appear, it is always in the Sen≈øe of Scripture joined with Sin; yet it hath thus much more of Danger in it, than that meerly it is ≈øinful: It is Sin ≈øome way guarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended again≈øt Divine Truth, and ≈øo holds <hi>its Goods more in Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its wound is no le≈øs deadly, yet more ≈øecret and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and therefore the wor≈øt ≈øort of Death: It is an Ambu≈øh of Death.</p>
                  <p>In the Sin of <hi>Scandal</hi> mo≈øt eminently it is, even as in that mo≈øt Enchanting Sin, That <hi>a Man goes after it, as an Oxe to the Slaughter, and as a Fool to the Correction of the Stocks; till a Dart ≈øtrike through his Liver: As a Bird ha≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for its Life: Scandal wipes its Mouth,</hi> when it de≈øtroys, and ≈øays, <hi>It hath done no wickedne≈øs; when it ≈øpeaketh fair, there are ≈øeven Abominations under it.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And this is of ≈øo great concernment, that though the thing be good a Man does, yet if he does it not upon a Judgement, a Sen≈øe, a Dictate of Con≈øcience; or if that he refu≈øes be truly Evil, yet if it be not rejected in the ≈øame manner, upon the ≈øame Motives, neither the one nor the other ari≈øes to a Religious action, or is accepted with God, as done in <hi>his Fear,</hi> but is <hi>a vain honour</hi> of him.</p>
                  <p>Now to the di≈øcharge of Con≈øcience, in this its ≈øo high Office and Tru≈øt it owes to it ≈øelf and the Soul, that it be richly and abundantly furni≈øhed with the knowledge of the Divine Will, and the <hi>Word of God dwelling</hi> in it; that ≈øeeing it is both the <hi>Scribe</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi> or, if I may ≈øo ≈øpeak, the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> of the Soul within it ≈øelf, it be as the <hi>good Hou≈øeholder,</hi> that <hi>brings forth out of his Trea≈øury things new and old,</hi> that it attend to all Means of In≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> entertain all Wi≈ødom,

                  <p>And that its influence may be powerful and effective upon the Soul, to all Holy and Heavenly Obedience, there mu≈øt be a ju≈øt pre≈øervation of its Authority, and good Conduct, that ≈øo it may promote the Soul into all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, having gained a high Reputation and Honour, by the ≈øucce≈øs it hath had already, and the comfort and good expectation it rai≈øes within the Soul, upon its happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: For the <hi>upright man,</hi> from this vigor of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>holds on his way,</hi> and grows <hi>≈øtronger and ≈øtronger;</hi> and <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore one of the principal <hi>Scandals</hi> Scripture remarques upon, is this, When Con≈øcience, upon any Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, upon any In≈øinuation, or U≈øurpation upon it, betrays this Tru≈øt, and ≈øurrenders it ≈øelf to any other Dictate or Authority, but that which is Divine; and that ≈øhining within it ≈øelf, and ≈øo a≈ø≈øuring it by its Rationality, Goodne≈øs, Purity, Maje≈øty, that it is from God: To take any thing upon tru≈øt from Men, that it does not try, and examine, or to let go any thing it hath ≈øo tryed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and found good, upon any pretence whatever, is indeed to be <hi>Scandali≈øed;</hi> that pretence, that does ≈øo a≈ø≈øume over it, and prevail with it again≈øt it ≈øelf, Scandali≈øes it.</p>
                  <p>For the charge of repre≈øenting to the Soul, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Laws, is committed to the Con≈øcience; the ≈øupream Moderation is in God, and the Divine Law; yet it is tran≈ømitted into the Soul, it enters thither through the Dictates of Con≈øcience; whatever then ≈øo impo≈øes on Con≈øcience, as that it recedes from its Government, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dali≈øes it; for the Government of God is lo≈øt al≈øo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65165:137"/>
                  <p> And though Con≈øcience cannot ju≈øtifie a man in any error, nor ought to po≈ø≈øe≈øs a Man with unnece≈ø≈øary ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; yet ≈øtill the main Government of Con≈øcience deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ≈øelf from God, and the true under≈øtanding of his Will, is by no means to be ≈øhaken.</p>
                  <p>For Man, as a Rational Creature, as a Creature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, cannot obey God, but by the Mediation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience. He mu≈øt know, and judge within him≈øelf, what is the Divine Law, and obey it. If he does in Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to that Will, and does not know it, it is not true Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becau≈øe it is not Religious; it is not rea≈øonable, or rationally Religious Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The Obedience of God is ≈øeated in the Judgment, in the Con≈øcience; if the≈øe Reins are ≈ølack and loo≈øe, if this Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bridle be neglected, Men know not whither they may run, upon what they may be driven, and never di≈øcover the danger. A man cannot di≈øtingui≈øh what is from God, from what is not; if this gu≈øt of the Soul be not quick, vigorou≈øly exerci≈øed, and left free.</p>
                  <p>Con≈øcience may be in≈øtructed, advi≈øed, per≈øwaded, yea, even menaced and terrified by the Applications of the Word of God to it; nay, it may be over-ruled by Lawful Authority, wherein it turns Apo≈øtate, or Renegade to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion; yet it can never be Lawfully depos'd, or put out of Authority: The My≈øtery of Faith, the Rule of Obedience, the Con≈øolation and Vigor of the Soul, are all pre≈øerved in a <hi>pure Con≈øcience,</hi> and <hi>Shipwracked</hi> together with it.</p>
                  <p>Now becau≈øe Con≈øcience is placed by God in this great Tru≈øt and Dignity; it becomes, and it mu≈øt needs become ≈øo great a matter of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> di≈øcour≈øes: when Con≈øcience not duly regarding its own light, and inward Sen≈øe ≈øurrenders it ≈øelf to a forreign Rule; ≈øteers it ≈øelf by a compa≈øs out of it ≈øelf; ≈øays, another ≈øhall be wi≈øe and ≈øee, and Dictate for it; and ≈øo gives up it ≈øelf in an implicite Faith, and blind Obedience.</p>

                  <p> Here is <hi>Scandal</hi> in its Delu≈øive, Deceptive Power; a Man thinks it mode≈øt, cautious, a point of Honour and Subjection to tho≈øe that are above him, to be carried by an Authority out of him≈øelf: Con≈øcience hereupon de≈øerts its own Principles, and its own place in directing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them: Upon this it falls into all the mi≈øerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences, the mi≈øchief of <hi>Scandal.</hi> Con≈øcience is <hi>wounded, grieved, weakned,</hi> and lies <hi>pro≈øtrate;</hi> and without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the <hi>work of God</hi> in the Natural, or new Creation, is <hi>de≈øtroyed,</hi> and even the Man for whom <hi>Chri≈øt dyed</hi> peri≈øhes.</p>
                  <p>God hath concredited the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Juri≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> within the Soul to Con≈øcience alone; and I cannot find that it can be at all excu≈øed in re≈øigning them into any Hand, but his that gave them; no not to an <hi>Angel from Heaven.</hi>

                  <p>But every Man mu≈øt ≈øee with his own Eyes, and not anothers for him, he mu≈øt be enlightned by Beams and Rayes that ≈øhine within his own Soul: He hath a private double Look upon him≈øelf, and none may <hi>open</hi> and <hi>≈øhut</hi> but Con≈øcience, in and with God: whoever el≈øe does, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Father,</hi> and a <hi>Ma≈øter upon Earth</hi> to him, in the place of God and Chri≈øt.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account the Apo≈øtle lays down the≈øe three <note place="margin">

                  <p>And I am here to undertake a particular and di≈øtinct con≈øideration of <hi>Scandal;</hi> as it hath a mo≈øt peculiar intere≈øt in tho≈øe ≈øo famous Debates of the Apo≈øtle, concerning <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. when they can any way be ≈øuppos'd to relate to God in the Notions of Religion, or have a pre≈øence, how circum≈øtantial ≈øoever, in Divine Wor≈øhip.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon this undertaking, I mu≈øt remove two Prejudices.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It mu≈øt be acknowledged, <hi>Scandal</hi> in the≈øe ca≈øes hath been indeed made Trivial, by ≈øome Mens injudicious Zeal, and ignorant dealing with the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> Sen≈øe herein; who having a crude Conception of <hi>Scandal,</hi> from what he hath ≈øpoken of it, as a mo≈øt formidable Evil, both in him that gives it, or takes it, have therefore called every
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65165:138"/> thing <hi>Scandal</hi> that di≈øplea≈øes them; and mean nothing by being <hi>≈øcandali≈øed,</hi> but that they have greatly di≈øliked ≈øuch or ≈øuch things, without any other hazard of falling into ≈øin, than what is to be feared from their indi≈øcreet anger, and too often over-pa≈ø≈øionate Inflammation; whence hath ri≈øen this <hi>Scandal,</hi> dangerous enough, That many are ready to believe, there is no ≈øuch thing as <hi>Scandal</hi> in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Things;</hi> except what <hi>unknowing Zeal</hi> in a ferment creates; or at lea≈øt have not taken into their thoughts this kind of true <hi>Scripture Scandal,</hi> or entertained a ju≈øt fear of running into it, or en≈ønaring others in it.</p>
                  <p>But it will be evident to any one that duly weighs, that the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> proceeds upon much deeper and more grave Con≈øiderations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the other ≈øide, the Fear of <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>≈øcandali≈øing</hi> hath been blown off by ≈øome, upon this mi≈øtake, That Men can be in no danger to be <hi>≈øcandali≈øed,</hi> who keep far enough from being drawn by Example into any thing they di≈ølike, and are ≈øufficiently angry at: The Ob≈øtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ≈øuch, they think, is a ≈øufficient Bar to them again≈øt <hi>Scandal,</hi> and again≈øt any ones being guilty, as an Author of <hi>Scandal</hi> to them, how hardly ≈øoever they pre≈øs upon them; while they profe≈øs ≈øo loudly their Di≈ø≈øent, they mu≈øt not ≈øo much as name <hi>Scandal,</hi> without the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gro≈øs Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be ju≈øtly apprehended, a man may be <hi>He, by whom Scandal comes,</hi> though it find no place in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt whom it comes; as hath been already ob≈øerved.</p>
                  <p>And further, Though the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> hath in the≈øe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances fixed chiefly upon that ≈øort of <hi>Scandal,</hi> within which men are drawn by following Example again≈øt their inward Sentiments; yet, by a parity of Rea≈øon, <hi>Scandal</hi> is to be ≈øu≈øpected to have much larger compa≈øs, even in <hi>things of Indifferency,</hi> and lying farther off from mens doubtful complying in what they have Example or Command for,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65165:139"/> than that ≈øuch complyance ≈øhould be the only mea≈øure of <hi>Scandal</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>And even in tho≈øe that do comply with freer minds, there are more ≈øecret Paths and Tracks wherein <hi>Scandals</hi> are laid, than they generally and openly make complaint of, and that not only in regard of inward Doubts, but upon other accounts al≈øo.</p>
                  <p>I ≈øhall therefore lay down the≈øe two Preparatories, to make the≈øe Di≈øcour≈øes of the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> more concerning to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we have great Rea≈øon to be a≈ø≈øured, they have their Foundation in the Denunciations of <hi>Woe</hi> by <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> upon <hi>the World</hi> becau≈øe of <hi>Scandal;</hi> upon him by whom <hi>Scandal comes,</hi> by way of tran≈øcendency; and his Admonition to all, that <hi>Scandals mu≈øt needs come:</hi> For the ≈øame <hi>Divine Spirit of Truth</hi> de≈øcended from the <hi>Ma≈øter</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Mini≈øter,</hi> and fram'd like Apprehen≈øions in him, when he ≈øpake afterward of the ≈øame point. Nay we have Rea≈øon to believe the latter Di≈øcour≈øe looks back upon the former, becau≈øe it was undoubtedly well known to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians then, and much more to the Apo≈øtle; who, be≈øides that he had <hi>immediate Revelations,</hi> mo≈øt probably from the Lord, even of tho≈øe things that were written by the <hi>Evangeli≈øts,</hi> gives proof he had a very peculiar care to know all He had ≈øpoken, and a ≈øingular re≈øpect to it; for he expre≈øly quotes our Saviour in tho≈øe immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as in the Ca≈øe of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. in what was written in the Evangeli≈øts, as in the Ca≈øe of Divorce, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>

                  <p>I begin with the fir≈øt, the ≈øtating the Nature of <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> with relation to God, in the≈øe four Characters of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are things in them≈øelves Lawful, Innocent, and in their U≈øe, as of them≈øelves, no way di≈øplea≈øing to God. So the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> pronounces, with great boldne≈øs and earne≈øtne≈øs, of <hi>Meats</hi> that were forbidden under the <hi>Law of Mo≈øes: I am</hi> (≈øaith he) in re≈øpect to them, <hi>per≈øwaded by the Lord Je≈øus, there is nothing unclean of it ≈øelf, but all things are pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Ca≈øe of <hi>Things offered to Idols,</hi> he declares, <hi>All things</hi> (viz. of that kind) <hi>are lawful,</hi> that is, with regard to the things them≈øelves, if they are u≈øed aright, if they are taken by the right Handle.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Meats</hi> have been <hi>offered to Idols,</hi> yet there is no ≈øuch thing as an <hi>Infinite Evil,</hi> that can taint <hi>what God hath made good. There is one God, the Father, of whom all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>things are</hi> originally, <hi>and we in him, and for him;</hi> and <hi>in</hi> or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65165:140"/> 
                     <hi>for</hi> no <hi>Idol</hi> or <hi>Demon: There is one Lord Je≈øus Chri≈øt, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, by whom,</hi> in a reconciled and attoned State, <hi>after the great Corruption and Cur≈øe by Sin, are all things, and we by him,</hi> and by no <hi>Demon-Mediator</hi> or <hi>Interce≈ø≈øor.</hi> This Right, Title, Claim, and Propriety of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> no <hi>Demon</hi> can expul≈øe. God and Chri≈øt <hi>≈øo fill all things,</hi> that an <hi>Idol</hi> can be but a <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The≈øe <hi>Indifferents,</hi> or the U≈øe of them, cannot <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God,</hi> as of them≈øelves: we are <hi>not the better if we eat, or the wor≈øe if we eat not; Meat commendeth us not to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There may yet be ≈øo Religious and Advantageous U≈øe of them, as that they may, by the ob≈øervation of all due Circum≈øtances, and the elevation of them to the be≈øt and worthie≈øt Ends, be <hi>Occa≈øions</hi> (I ≈øay, <hi>Occa≈øions</hi> onely) of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Service, and Glory to God, and that on either ≈øide; which ≈øhews their Indifferency; for one ≈øide may be made an occa≈øion of Religious Action, as well as the other; and ≈øo neither ≈øide obliges us more than other: <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and giveth God thanks; He that eateth not to the Lord, he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. He that eateth Meat offered to Idols,</hi> in <hi>Gods Right,</hi> and not in <hi>the Right of the Demon,</hi> is a Partaker by <hi>Grace;</hi> or Divine Bounty, through Chri≈øt. For, the Meat is Gods, and his Provi≈øion; and the <hi>Idol,</hi> to him that under≈øtands, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it; and therefore he <hi>giveth God thanks,</hi> and not <hi>the Idol.</hi> It is in relation to the≈øe things, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle commands, <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do,</hi> (that is, or <hi>not eat,</hi> or <hi>not drink) do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They may be u≈øed ami≈øs both ways. In ≈øome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances, <hi>It is good not to eat Fle≈øh, or drink Wine, even while the World ≈øtandeth.</hi> They may in ≈øome Circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>be inexpedients,</hi> and <hi>not edifie;</hi> that is, by a diminutive way of ≈øpeaking, run counter to the Ends of <hi>Edification;</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65165:141"/> and <hi>Scandali≈øe</hi> others. They that have knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their true nature, and the be≈øt u≈øe of them, may yet ≈øo u≈øe them, as <hi>to ≈øin again≈øt the Brethren,</hi> and <hi>wound their righteous Con≈øcience,</hi> and ≈øo <hi>≈øin again≈øt Chri≈øt.</hi> But they that Eat <hi>without knowledge,</hi> Eat ≈øo as <hi>to Eat with Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> to <hi>doubt,</hi> and <hi>be damned in their Eating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the the other ≈øide, they which u≈øe them not, that <hi>Eat not,</hi> that <hi>will not Eat,</hi> may ≈øo not Eat, as to turn them into another ≈øort of <hi>Scandal,</hi> while they grow ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtitiou≈øly affraid to <hi>touch, ta≈øte,</hi> or <hi>handle;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that u≈øeth <hi>Indefferent things</hi> aright, only makes u≈øe of that ≈øide of them he choo≈øes, as an occa≈øion or acting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Chri≈øtian <hi>fully per≈øwaded in his own mind to eat eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and giveth God thanks;</hi> but knows <hi>meat commends him not to God,</hi> makes it no matter of Religion <hi>to eat,</hi> and ≈øo in ca≈øe of <hi>Scandal</hi> forbears it. The Chri≈øtian that <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> maketh u≈øe of the liberty he hath, as in <hi>an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing, not to eat</hi> either <hi>meats unclean</hi> according to <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> or things <hi>offered to Idols;</hi> without laying any ≈øtre≈øs of Religion upon his ab≈øtinence in either, but only the a≈ø≈øurance he is not the wor≈øe in not eating, and thereby avoiding the inconvenience of either doubting in him≈øelf, or <hi>≈øcandali≈øing</hi> any other: In the ≈øame manner he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth u≈øe of his liberty in <hi>di≈øtingui≈øhing</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> upon any good occa≈øion, that was di≈øtingui≈øhed under <hi>the Law,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ob≈øerving of Days</hi> as a point of Religion, but only places a Religious Action on that <hi>Day,</hi> according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he hath in an <hi>indifferent thing:</hi> And ≈øo avoids the Doubt in him≈øelf of not ob≈øerving what is Commanded, and the <hi>≈øcandal</hi> to any other.</p>
                  <p>But now he that <hi>not eating</hi> ≈ølips unawares into a ≈øurmi≈øe of Evil in the things them≈øelves, and that he does a great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65165:141"/> act of Religion in <hi>not eating,</hi> and ≈øo dares not <hi>touch, ta≈øte, handle;</hi> or he that would gain, as he thinks, upon God by <hi>ob≈øerving Days,</hi> he falls into the <hi>Scandal</hi> of making his Weakne≈øs a part of his Religion; even as he that for the vaunt of his liberty eats licentiou≈øly, and carele≈øly of others; or thinks in <hi>eating</hi> he does God ≈øervice: or in <hi>eating</hi> ≈ølides into his old awes or pangs of Devotion to the <hi>Idol,</hi> and <hi>eats</hi> in his Right, to his Honour, and ≈øo is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: or la≈øtly, <hi>eats</hi> when he is in doubt of the lawfulne≈øs, upon the credit of Example, which is the proper <hi>Scandal</hi> the Apo≈øtle aims at.</p>
                  <p>Now from all the≈øe Characters it is mo≈øt evident,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Indifferent Things</hi> are far below the Scale of Divine In≈øtitutions, though the≈øe In≈øtitutions are but Po≈øitive, and not of Eternal Goodne≈øs and Righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
                  <p>All the Appointments of God and Chri≈øt are lifted up into that ≈øtate the Divine Appointment de≈øigns them to; and ≈øhall, if u≈øed according to tho≈øe Appointments, be made efficacious to tho≈øe Ends for which they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the effectual working of that Power and Grace from which they received their Original: So that they do <hi>make us better,</hi> they do <hi>commend us to God,</hi> if we ob≈øerve the Will and Law of God concerning them; and <hi>we are the wor≈øe</hi> in the ≈øinful neglect of them, according to the degree of neglect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not of the Scale of tho≈øe things, wherein that Order, of which God, by the very laws of Rational Nature is the Author, ≈øtands; and not of <hi>Confu≈øion;</hi> ≈øo that though this Order runs, or ought to run along, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all Humane Actions, and ≈øo is not in it ≈øelf a point of Religion; yet when it is applyed to Religious Services and Actions, doth indeed commend our Religious Actions and Services to God, and the contrary is an Evil.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65165:142"/> 3. Of the ≈øame account is that <hi>Eu≈øchemonia,</hi> or Decency of Religious Actions, required by God before him≈øelf, and before the <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> of which the Apo≈øtle di≈øcour≈øes; <hi>Every man praying with his Head uncoverd, di≈øhonoureth his Head;</hi> every Woman praying ≈øo, ought to have a <hi>covering on her Head, becau≈øe of the Angels;</hi> ≈øuch a di≈øtinction of Sexes being founded in Nature; and in what is beyond Nature, the grave Cu≈øtoms of Ages and Places, carry a great weight of Determination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The mo≈øt <hi>indifferent Circum≈øtances,</hi> that yet mo≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily attend all ≈øerious, and important humane Actions, (and therefore Religious Actions) when once determined, by the Prudence and mature con≈øideration of tho≈øe that have greate≈øt right to determine therein, as Times, Places, and general Order of Publick Wor≈øhip, become (however <hi>indifferent</hi> in them≈øelves) yet above <hi>indifferent</hi> in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations; becau≈øe the undue change of them is not only Levity, but approaches to Frenzy.</p>
                  <p>And now I have ≈øo far ≈øettled the Nature of <hi>Indifferents,</hi> that I think no variety of Circum≈øtances can make an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in any, more than in tho≈øe Eternal Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things. I come therefore to the Second thing in the Platform I have given of the Apo≈øtles Di≈øcour≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To inquire how <hi>Scandal</hi> invades the≈øe ≈øo innocent <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies,</hi> when they come into a Relation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>And the very ground or advantage of its entry, is through this very Relation to Religion. For therein is the very Center of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as a Corruption of the be≈øt thing; there is its great Power and Sting, to di≈øorder the ≈øtate of things betwixt God and Man; and the more any thing comes into that con≈øideration, the more efficacious is <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> upon it, if not warily prevented.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65165:142"/>
                  <p> And it is therefore the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Policie, to leave all things without the <hi>Line of Religion,</hi> or <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip,</hi> that can be ≈øpared, and are not of nece≈ø≈øary u≈øe to it, to cut off all broad <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> on that very account, that Scandal is ≈øo attempting, and invading, and nothing ≈øafe from its A≈ø≈øaults; even as indefen≈øible Buildings in a Garri≈øon are pulled down and ≈ølighted, le≈øt the Enemy make advantage of them to cover him≈øelf. Incumbring Religion with <hi>Indifferents,</hi> more than needs mu≈øt, are but ≈øo many Shelters for <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal</hi> then, in <hi>Indifferent things</hi> pertaining to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is an Occa≈øion taken upon them, as they ≈øtand in that Relation, to act, under ≈øome pretence, contrary to any of the great Principles or Laws of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things are brought into a Relation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By ≈øome Appointment of God, who alone hath Right to do it, exalting Indifferent Things into a Goodne≈øs above their Nature, or for wi≈øe Purpo≈øes depre≈ø≈øing them below their Nature; which Appointment cea≈øing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, they return each of them into their own natural <hi>Indifferency,</hi> and are alike <hi>good</hi> and <hi>clean;</hi> and upon the ju≈øt Level of their fir≈øt Creation, of them≈øelves are nothing to Religion, e≈øpecially as it is perfected in Chri≈øtianity. This was the Ca≈øe the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> treats upon to the <hi>Romans:</hi> There was a Law of God by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> di≈øtingui≈øhing <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Meats;</hi> this Law was out dated by Chri≈øt; all things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returned into their original State of equal Goodne≈øs and Cleanne≈øs, and were wholly alike, as to any Religious Account of them, to all that under≈øtood the aboli≈øhing of that Law, which at that time was but beginning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Indifferents</hi> are brought into a Relation to Religion, by Mans Idolatrous or Super≈øtitious Tran≈ømutation of them out of their Natures, either above or below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; which being greatly abominable to God, as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65165:143"/> to his ≈øole Right, and very de≈øtructive to Mans Soul, debauches the≈øe Indifferents into great Impurity, to all that with De≈øign and Re≈øolution will under≈øtand and u≈øe them ≈øo changed: To them that are <hi>unbelieving and defiled</hi> is <hi>nothing pure, but even their Mind and Con≈øcience is defiled.</hi>

                  <p>This was the Ca≈øe the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> rea≈øons upon to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths.</hi>

                     <hi>The Meats offered to Idols, the Idols Temple,</hi> were mo≈øt impure to the <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and Super≈øtitions:</p>

                  <p>This was mo≈øt amply declared in the Go≈øpel-≈øtate of Things.</p>

                  <p>The Principle, Con≈øcience, in the Ca≈øe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> had lying hard upon it, was this:</p>
                  <p>Whatever God hath forbidden once, <hi>as unclean,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and is ≈øo long unclean, till we know that Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is removed.

                     <hi>Con≈øcience</hi> in the <hi>Corinths</hi> had this Principle looking it full in the Face; To <hi>eat in an Idols Right,</hi> in <hi>Honour to Idols,</hi> is an abomination to God. The weak Chri≈øtian abhorring <hi>Idols,</hi> or to <hi>eat in Honour of them,</hi> did not as yet under≈øtand there could be a Separation betwixt the Pollution of the <hi>Idol,</hi> and the <hi>Meat,</hi> or the <hi>Temple</hi> where he was wor≈øhipped: yet emboldned by ≈øeeing the <hi>≈øtronger ≈øit at Meat in an Idols Temple,</hi> they <hi>eat,</hi> and were inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted at the unclean Meat they <hi>eat;</hi> they <hi>eat with Con≈øcience of the Idol,</hi> the <hi>Meat as offered to the Idol,</hi> through the force of Example; that is, abhorring indeed <hi>the Idol,</hi> and his <hi>Meat;</hi> but withal, fearing it, as an Evil, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Meat as impure, becau≈øe <hi>≈øacrificed to an Idol.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Impo≈øer</hi> then, though but by Example, is he that <hi>≈øcandali≈øes:</hi> The Complier again≈øt the Sen≈øe of his own Mind, in≈øtructed not by Truth and Rea≈øon ≈øatisfying him, but by Example leading him, is the <hi>Scandali≈øed.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now to bring this to the Balance with Impo≈øitions in <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>Indifferents,</hi> in after-Times.

                  <p>But let us withal allow, That though no Man can be the <hi>better</hi> for u≈øing the≈øe <hi>Indifferents,</hi> nor the <hi>wor≈øe</hi> for not u≈øing them; yet there is a Liberty to <hi>u≈øe them,</hi> without being the <hi>wor≈øe</hi> for u≈øing them, if a Man be <hi>fully per≈øuaded in his own mind</hi> concerning them.

                  <p> And that therefore, He that u≈øes them ≈øo as to pre≈øs tho≈øe that are <hi>otherwi≈øe minded,</hi> to a Conformity, by his Example (if it be no more), much more if by <hi>De≈øpi≈øings,</hi> Cen≈øures, Vexations, Penalties; he does not <hi>walk charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> he <hi>≈øins again≈øt Chri≈øtians, wounds their weak Con≈øciences,</hi> and ≈øo <hi>≈øins again≈øt Chri≈øt</hi> in a high Degree; and for his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the <hi>work of God is de≈øtroyed,</hi> and he <hi>for whom Chri≈øt died peri≈øhes,</hi> if not ≈øav'd by Repentance.

                  </p>
                  <p>For, it cannot but be ≈øuppos'd, there are many that are wrought upon, again≈øt the ≈øen≈øe of their own Minds, to ≈øuch a Conformity, as wherein they cannot but <hi>condemn them≈øelves</hi> wherein they ≈øeem <hi>to allow them≈øelves,</hi> or do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>allow them≈øelves,</hi> ≈øo far as the outward Act reaches: Who can doubt, but in the≈øe days there are ≈øuch, as well as in the Days of the fir≈øt Chri≈øtians?

                     <p>Seeing then all Humane Authority mu≈øt lower its Top to Divine, I cannot ≈øee, but that, in <hi>Indifferent things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which is Gods peculiar, for we ≈øpeak only of that, the Magi≈øtrates Power is excluded, in ca≈øe of real <hi>doubt</hi> of <hi>Con≈øcience,</hi> in which a Man can do nothing, but he runs into Gods danger, even as in any other ca≈øe of ≈øuch danger, by rea≈øon of Sin. And what is offered in Relief, will not avail, <hi>viz.</hi> That Obedience to Magi≈øtrates is certainly a Duty; but whether there be any di≈øobedience to God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ≈øuch or ≈øuch <hi>Indifferents,</hi> is in <hi>doubt;</hi> and if the thing be indeed <hi>indifferent,</hi> it is a <hi>doubt</hi> upon mi≈øtake: And then there is a di≈øobedience to God, in an <hi>undoubted</hi> Rule, and Command to avoid it in a ca≈øe not only of <hi>doubt,</hi> but of mi≈øtake.</p>
                     <p>This, I ≈øay, cannot avail; Becau≈øe the mea≈øure is not to be drawn betwixt Obedience to Magi≈øtrates in all <hi>lawful things,</hi> or <hi>things indifferent;</hi> but betwixt Obedience to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates, and Obedience to that Rule of the Word of God in all ca≈øes of <hi>doubt,</hi> which is as clear, and as little ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>doubt,</hi> as any Rule whatever. Yet does not this evacuate the Power of Magi≈øtrates, it being re≈øtrained to things <hi>indifferent</hi> in Religion, and in <hi>Doubt,</hi> and the <hi>Doubt</hi> fixed upon a grand Principle of Truth.</p>
                     <p>Nor is that of greater ≈øatisfaction, That in Obedience to Magi≈øtrates, there are ≈øo many degrees of Good, and ≈øo many of Evil in the Di≈øobedience; but in doing well or ill, concerning <hi>Indifferents,</hi> there are much fewer Degrees, both of the Good, and the Evil; therefore Obedience to God, in ≈øo great a <hi>Morality,</hi> as Obedience to Magi≈øtrates, is always to be preferred before our doing well in <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;</hi> and the fear of Evil in one, to be avoided much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the ≈øame fear in the other.</p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65165:152"/>
                     <p> The Rea≈øon of Di≈ø≈øatisfaction is this, That the Mea≈øure is not betwixt the Morality of Obedience to God, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magi≈øtrates, and doing well or ill about things <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> but betwixt the Morality of <hi>Obeying God</hi> in one of his clear and undoubted Precepts, and in another of the ≈øame Evidence and Clearne≈øs; which mu≈øt needs be one and the ≈øame, and of the ≈øame Rate of <hi>Morality:</hi> Seeing Obedience to God is the <hi>Fundamental Morality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it were not thus, the Magi≈øtrates Prohibition of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of the <hi>Cup in the Lords Supper,</hi> mu≈øt exempt from Obedience to God in tho≈øe Duties; becau≈øe Obedience to Magi≈øtrates is a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, but the other <hi>Ceremonial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is out of Mea≈øure certain, Obedience to God is both the top and the bottom of all <hi>Morality;</hi> and although Obedience to Magi≈øtrates is a great point of <hi>Morality,</hi> yet Obedience to God is ≈øo before it, as to be the Mea≈øure of it.</p>
                     <p>Be≈øides, if Obedience to God be to be valued not by his Authority, but by weighing the Precepts them≈øelves, much more Obedience to Magi≈øtrates is to be e≈øtimated by the Commands they give, of which <hi>Indifferents</hi> in Religion will never be made out to be worthy to be the Te≈øts, either of their Authority, or our Obedience; whatever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Men have ≈øaid therein.</p>
                     <p>Indeed among the Divine Commands, God hath cho≈øen <hi>Mercy,</hi> rather than <hi>Sacrifice, honouring Parents,</hi> rather than <hi>Corban,</hi> but it is becau≈øe he hath ≈øo declared in his Word, and in Mens Con≈øciences.</p>
                     <p>But all the Laws of God do harmoniou≈øly Con≈øpire, and Subordinate them≈øelves one to another, among which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Magi≈øtrates, and Pre≈øerving the Government, and Peace of Con≈øcience, are none of the lea≈øt, nor of any conte≈øt, or di≈øtance of unkindne≈øs between them≈øelves: <hi>Who≈øo is wi≈øe?

                     <p>But if none of the≈øe can be laid to their Charge; yet if Men doubt concerning them, what mu≈øt they do?

                     <p>Upon the whole then, I cannot but conclude, Impo≈øing Indifferent Things in Religion, by a violent Example; much more by ≈øevere Ways, is very contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles Doctrine in that Ca≈øe; and that upon Rea≈øons, that till I ≈øee them an≈øwered, I mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe unan≈øwerable.</p>

                     <p>In the mean time I will not be afraid to ≈øay, There is a very horrible <hi>Scandal</hi> ri≈øing at this very time, even a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant Popery,</hi> placing ≈øuch an ab≈øolute Dependence upon Succe≈ø≈øion from the <hi>Apo≈øtles</hi> (without cautioning for any thing of their true Spirit) and which ≈øo hangs Salvation at the Girdle of tho≈øe that would be their Succe≈ø≈øours, as turns Chri≈øtianity into a mo≈øt <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tirannick Party.</hi>

                     <p>But they that know the Scriptures, know a≈ø≈øuredly, Chri≈øt hath founded no Rule, Government, or Authority in his Church, whatever, but who≈øe whole di≈øplay of it ≈øelf is in Teaching, In≈øtructing according to his Word: If that be not clear and evident, the whole Authority and Power falls to the Ground.

                     </p>
                     <p>But in this Univer≈øal Rage of <hi>Scandal,</hi> God hath not ≈øo for≈øaken the World, but that his <hi>Spirit lifts up a Standard again≈øt it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Scandal</hi> hath only a permi≈ø≈øion from God, a Di≈øpen≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to manife≈øt it ≈øelf; it is always ≈øubject to Truth, as Night is to Day: It is ≈øubject to be reduc'd, and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as God plea≈øes.</p>

We may from hence learn the great unrea≈øonablene≈øs of being <hi>Scandali≈øed;</hi> that there are ≈øo many <hi>Scandals</hi> again≈øt Religion not marked with Vengeance. If we con≈øider well the ≈øtate of the World, how can it be otherwi≈øe?

Nor is it a <hi>Hell</hi> where there is <hi>Scandal, all Scandal</hi> and <hi>no Religion,</hi> but <hi>Scandal</hi> under Divine Vengeance, <hi>Scandal</hi> all in a Flame with the Wrath of God, di≈øcovering what it is, ≈øo that it can intrap none any longer, but tho≈øe that are its Va≈ø≈øals for ever.</p>
                     <p>This World then is a World of <hi>Scandals,</hi> and <hi>≈øcandali≈øed;</hi> only it is under a Di≈øcipline, an Admini≈øtration of Grace, like an <hi>Ho≈øpital,</hi> a <hi>Bethlehem</hi> for <hi>Lunaticks,</hi> the <hi>Lunaticks of Scandal,</hi> the <hi>Infani,</hi> as Holy Writ calls them.

                  <p>I know the Things I have written cannot be duely received without much Thinking, and without that they will be in danger of a Cen≈øori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rejection from the mo≈øt, or of a ≈øuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unintelligent Acceptance in the Kinder; which is as bad as the other, and therefore I pre≈øent it as a <hi>Catechi≈øm;</hi> to tho≈øe that ≈øhall at all approve it, that they may be throughly ver≈øed in it, and the Sen≈øe of it grow Dome≈øtick to them.</p>
                  <p>I call it a <hi>Catholick Catechi≈øm,</hi> only with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Great Subjects it Treats of, the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in tho≈øe things wherein they are <hi>Catholick;</hi> or in which their <hi>Catholickne≈øs</hi> con≈øi≈øt: That is, that they are of God, and that the whole Society of Holy and Happy Spirits is by that <hi>Catholickne≈øs</hi> united, and clo≈øely banded with it ≈øelf. <hi>Catholick,</hi> as the Epi≈øtles called <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is, after ≈øome Doubt A≈ø≈øerted to be Divine, of the Publick Spirit of God, and giving that Publick Doctrine, in which the General A≈ø≈øembly is one.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65165:172"/>
                  <p> I have endeavoured to contrive the Que≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and An≈øwers ≈øo, that the An≈øwers may be an <hi>Apology,</hi> or Defen≈øive An≈øwer of that <hi>Catholick Truth,</hi> giving a <hi>Rea≈øon,</hi> or a <hi>Rational Account,</hi> to any Demand that can be made upon it: And it is the <hi>Apology</hi> of that Truth it ≈øelf; the <hi>Apology</hi> it gives and furni≈øhes us with, for other can no Man give: Truth can need no other, than its <hi>Native Apology</hi> for it ≈øelf; no other will it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
                  <p>To give this, and to be always ready to give it, to keep it within us, and to have it fitted to our Lips, is the proper Fruit of ≈øuch a <hi>Catecheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal In≈øtruction;</hi> and the <hi>Apo≈øtle</hi> a≈ø≈øures us, it is the great Duty of Chri≈øtianity, and the greate≈øt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we can do to God, Fir≈øt to <hi>Sanctifie him in our Hearts, by a full acknowledgment of him in his Divine Truth;</hi> by a <hi>Plerophory, or full A≈ø≈øurance of <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nder≈øtanding in the My≈øtery of God, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of Chri≈øt.</hi> For a Devotion to the True God, without knowing him to be the True God, cannot thus Sanctifie or Honour him.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing we ≈øhould be more Rational in, than in the True Religion, the Account of which, and of its whole Content, ought to be ≈øo certain to us, that nothing of a Diver≈øe Spirit from it, can be added to it; nor any thing of its Integral or E≈ø≈øential Nature taken from it; but
<pb facs="tcp:65165:173"/> we may plainly ≈øee, it would change the Account; and ≈øo we need not make a Traver≈øe over all Fal≈øehood to know Truth, but by having a Right under≈øtanding in, and Ju≈øt Contemplation of Truth, the mo≈øt even thing in the whole World; we come to know it ≈øelf, by it ≈øelf, and to be a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øured of it, although there were no other Fal≈øe Religion in the World to compare it with, and ≈øet it off by, and withal to de≈øcry <hi>every fal≈øe way</hi> offered to us, and to <hi>hate it:</hi> Yea we ob≈øerve every thing that is but doubtfully Propo≈øed, and ≈øtay it its due time of Examination, and ≈øo either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or reject it, or if we ≈øee full rea≈øon for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øtill ≈øu≈øpend.</p>
                  <p>It is not the Laws of our Country, our Church, our being Baptiz'd, or Educated in it, that will ju≈øtifie our Religion to be the True: It is not the High Reverence of it, the Devotion we u≈øe in it, our hating of tho≈øe that ≈øpeak Bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemou≈øly of it, will make good our Religion, what Religion in the World may not be ju≈øtified upon ≈øuch Topicks? It is not that we find many great Principles of Truth in a Religion, that will ju≈øtifie it: There is no Religion, that can be called R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:65165:173"/> Chri≈øtanity, but hath Built upon them New Creeds of its own, and ≈øo Corrupted all: For what is ≈øo pure, and perfect, as True Religion is, mu≈øt needs be Corrupted by any Addition: All that is Pure and True, is already its own; who then can add to it, and not be found a Lyar?</p>
                  <p>Nothing therefore, as I have already intimated, can be our ≈øecurity for True Religion, but the <hi>Ju≈øt Divine Mea≈øure,</hi> the <hi>Common Faith,</hi> the <hi>True Catholick Standard,</hi> which in all things nece≈ø≈øary to the main End, is mo≈øt evident, and in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing that is not ≈øo evident, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ≈øo upon this Great Te≈øt, this is our Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
                  <p>For it is very plain, there is le≈øs danger when our Under≈øtandings are not yet extended to the breadth of Divine Truth, (if none of the Vital Principles are unknown to us, un≈øen≈øed by us, which are ≈øo exceedingly plain, that we cannot be, except willfully, ignorant of them,) for no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is done to Truth, that we do not under≈øtand its whole Compa≈øs; nor to our ≈øelves, if we do not hate knowledge, offering it ≈øelf to our notices, but in adding to Truth, ≈øeeing we can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to add, but what is of no worth, we mu≈øt needs defile it; in having only Truth, though we have not all Truth, we yet are under the Influence of Truth only, but when we add,
<pb facs="tcp:65165:174"/> we en≈ølave our ≈øelves to <hi>Lying Vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now hereunto have I levelled the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuing <hi>Catechi≈øm,</hi> or Di≈øcour≈øe; again≈øt which I know many prejudices will lie, except full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration be allowed: I know too many things rai≈øe a Dete≈øtation at the fir≈øt, which being Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and Weighed by their Rea≈øon, gain not only the Di≈øcharge of the≈øe Angry Pa≈ø≈øions, but much Acceptance and A≈ø≈øent: And I mu≈øt take the Confidence to ≈øay, in relation to any ≈øuch Doubt upon the en≈øuing <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Catholick Truth,</hi> that it is ≈øettled upon ≈øuch unmoveable Rea≈øon, and Weigh'd out by ≈øuch exact atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to it, that I may write upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Immode≈øty; <hi>Loe this, we have ≈øearched it, ≈øo it is, hear it, and know thou it for thy good;</hi> for good in the Quiet and mo≈øt Peaceable Cour≈øe of Chri≈øtianity, wherein to know the True Grounds upon which it re≈øts, alone makes the Soul both Wi≈øe and Good, and determines it to the Square and Ju≈øt Rules of that Holy Religion; for Good in times of Temptation to a Fal≈øe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, e≈øpecially that which calls it ≈øelf <hi>Catholick.</hi> For the truly In≈øtructed Chri≈øtian, in that which is indeed <hi>Catholick,</hi> is even Impregnable again≈øt that Delu≈øion of <hi>Catholick, fal≈øely ≈øo called;</hi> La≈øtly, for good, in the mid≈øt of great Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Diver≈øities of Opinion and Practice, in

                     <p n="3">3. Becau≈øe Gods Manife≈øtations of him≈øelf are the only true Publick Authentick Records of this Religion, and all other not derived from hence are private and fal≈øe, and the Meetings ≈øet up to celebrate any other Religion, than thus manife≈øted, are indeed the clo≈øe Schi≈ømatical Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: For none can be Publick A≈ø≈øemblies, where God, the ≈øupremely Publick, and all holy Spirits, withdrawn with him, are not: And all are Publick, though but of two or three, where God the Publick it ≈øelf, and in whom the whole A≈ø≈øembly of Saints meets, is in the mid≈øt of them.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Whence do you take occa≈øion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> From the Apo≈øtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who when he is a≈ø≈øert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the certainty of the Scripture Prophecy, affirms it a Principle ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary to be known, that it is not of any Private Interpretation; and that he may demon≈øtrate it cannot be Private, he avows the Original
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:177"/> to be Divine. Now the plain Oppo≈øite to Private is Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; in that therefore the Apo≈øtle does not oppo≈øe Publick, but Divine, to Private; it is plain in his ≈øen≈øe, Divine is the only Publick; and whatever is truly Publick is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and all el≈øe Private.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>How therefore are we to under≈øtand Private, to oppo≈øe it to Publick or Divine?</hi>

And la≈øtly, to ≈øuch who≈øe care, intere≈øt, and concern is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to them≈øelves and their own: Even thus Private is ju≈øtly affixed to all; except only to God, and Religion as derived from him. No created Knowledge, either Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Humane, is comprehen≈øive enough to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; no Power or Authority is ≈øupreme or va≈øt enough to Enact; nor is any care or concern for the world of Souls, large or receptive enough to Ordain a Catholick Religion leading to a Common Salvation, but his who is the Father of the whole Family of Spirits in Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>What Evidence of this is there?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Work that God commands Men to do is written in their heart, <hi>their Con≈øciences bearing witne≈øs, and their Thoughts in the mean time accu≈øing or excu≈øing one another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Eternal Word, or Rea≈øon, that made all things, is <hi>the Light that lighteth</hi> the Rea≈øon of <hi>every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world.</hi>

                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Which is the ≈øecond Record?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The ≈øecond Record is Divine Revelation collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Holy Scriptures; All Scripture is given by in≈øpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Correction in Righteou≈øne≈øs; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furni≈øhed to every good work. No Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie of Scripture is of any Private Interpretation; for Prophe≈øie came not in old time by the Will of Man, but holy men of God ≈øpake as they were moved by the Holy Gho≈øt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And even as the Law of Nature is ≈øeal'd by Creation and Providence, ≈øo hath Revelation always been by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Divinity, and Miracles; a new Creation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Ends of tho≈øe Revelations: Miracles of meer Power or Ju≈øtice, as upon <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> of greate≈øt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Benefaction only, as by the mo≈øt merciful Saviour; of Mercy, and ≈øometimes of Ju≈øtice, as by <hi>Mo≈øes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the Apo≈øtles, who were to e≈øtabli≈øh the Laws of the Old and New Te≈øtament.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65165:178"/>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> No: For ≈øome Parts of Religion are ≈øo nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our very Natures, as Men, that they were concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with us, and engraven upon our very Souls, and the immediate motions of our Faculties mu≈øt needs lead us to them, while right and ≈øtreight, and continuing in that perfect ≈øtate wherein our Creator left them.</p>
                     <p>For he looked upon all things that he had made, and behold all was good, and very good: And he appointed a Sabbati≈øm for all his Creatures, and e≈øpecially his Rational Creatures, the Morning Stars, to ≈øing together, and prai≈øe him for them.</p>
                     <p>But there are other Divine Truths, which are as the breaking up of the Great Deep of the Infinite Wi≈ødom, Grace, and Goodne≈øs of God, that can be known to the highe≈øt Under≈øtandings of Angels, or Arch-Angels, only by Revelation: Much le≈øs to Man, a Rea≈øon of a lower Orb, and lea≈øt of all, as fallen and corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Yet ≈øuppo≈øing the Souls of Men had abode in their fir≈øt Clearne≈øs and Lu≈øter, all his Faculties would have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately received and adored God in all ≈øuch Manife≈øtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him≈øelf, and Congratulated tho≈øe mighty Acce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions of Light and Truth.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he continued ≈øo?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Revelation was even then nece≈ø≈øary, to ≈øhew, that it is not con≈øi≈øtent with the Nature of a Creature to have Happine≈øs and Perfection within it ≈øelf; but to be in continual dependence upon, and expectation from the Creator: For even that Perfection wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was made, was thus to maintain, continue, and a≈ø≈øure it ≈øelf; and ≈øo to ri≈øe to higher Perfection; He had therefore at fir≈øt a Doctrine by Revelation, ≈øutable to the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Trees, ≈øo that though he was Perfect, as ≈øuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65165:179"/> a Creature without Sin, yet he was made with a po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of higher Advancement, and Perfection; as he was of falling from his pre≈øent Perfection, by not adhering to his Creator, according to what was revealed to him.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>What Relation do the≈øe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is therefore impo≈ø≈øible, they ≈øhould either of them one contradict another, but that they unite with, confirm, and ju≈øtifie one another, and one pa≈øs out of, and repa≈øs into another; but the latter being more full, clear, and perfect, makes not only the Additions of what was not contained in the former, but does much inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and clear it; and ≈øince the Fall, it is no where el≈øe perfectly to be found, but in Revelation: Yet ≈øo, that whatever of it remains, or is reinkindled by Revelation, does both prepare a Man to receive, and does al≈øo a≈ø≈øure him the truth of Divine Revelation.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>You have ≈øhewed with what Wi≈ødom, Goodne≈øs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid by the Creator, let me now hear from you the u≈øe I am to make of it?</hi>

                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> No, by no means: For, if <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradi≈øe had Revelation to make his State towards God Con≈øummate, how much more Man Fallen, in whom all Natural Light is but glimmering and ob≈øcure, Heavenly Objects at ≈øo great a remove, by his being ≈øunk down ≈øo low from them, and the Mi≈øts and Fogs of this Earth ≈øo prevalent upon him in the great Deordination of Spirit into Body, that whatever true Principles of Rea≈øon might effect, if duely pur≈øued, he is, without Revelation, upon all Experiment, no better than in <hi>the Valley of the Shadow of Death?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But does there appear any Expectation of Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Motions of Natural Rea≈øon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Very great; ≈øo that no Religion in the World hath been without the Pretence of it: And it is both mo≈øt hopeful according to the Laws of Natural Light, that God will reveal him≈øelf; and mo≈øt ju≈øt, that his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ≈øhould be accepted with all Reverence, when vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øafed: our very Rea≈øon being a Revelation from him; and if any Revelation from him could be fal≈øe, even That might be ≈øo al≈øo: But in all things, Natural Light mu≈øt needs bow to Divine Veracity.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>How happy might the World be, if all the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the World were but reformed to this Natural True Religion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Undoubtedly ≈øo: for the State of it could not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65165:182"/> then be far from the Kingdom of God; all True Religion, whether Natural or Revealed, being ≈øo clo≈øely allied to it ≈øelf: For though Revealed ri≈øes much higher, yet in an in≈øeparable connexion with, and in a continuation undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Natural.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But as the State of the World is, and hath always been, there ≈øeems to have been no Effect of True Natural Religion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Very great, in many re≈øpects. 1. To ju≈øtifie God in his Dealings with Mankind, that there have been ≈øuch Po≈ø≈øibilities of Return to True Religion laid up in them. 2. To be as Sen≈øe in a Mans Soul, upon which all Divine Applications might take, either to Conviction, or Conver≈øion. 3. To be at all times ready to be re-enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened by Revealed Truth, and to unite with it. 4. To be an Univer≈øal Code of True Religion, in which it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rea≈øonable for Mankind to agree, or in any Parts of it, on any Occa≈øion, as <hi>Jonah</hi> and the Mariners did in their Calamity, or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the Seamen with him, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Thanks to God. 5. That it might be a Standard to puni≈øh Prophanene≈øs and Irreligion by, without entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Con≈øcience; which Revelation cannot be, but in ≈øome peculiar Circum≈øtances. 6. That Men may on all Occa≈øions treat with one another by it, on Terms of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and Ju≈øtice, as the Apo≈øtle <hi>Paul</hi> with the Men of <hi>Athens,</hi> with <hi>Felix;</hi> and generally Men one with another, in all their Commerce: All Society, good Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Re≈øtraint of exce≈ø≈øive Evil, depending upon it.</p>

                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Be≈øides Gods Revealing him≈øelf to <hi>Adam,</hi> even in Innocency, in a Doctrine ≈øuitable to tho≈øe two Sacramental Trees, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life; and be≈øides that Original Revelation of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> after the Fall, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ≈øhall break the Serpents Head;</hi> he hath been plea≈øed to guide that Holy Seed, which is his Church, by Revelation, as by a Pillar of Fire, throughout ≈øucceeding Ages, till he compleated the whole he intended, in a Kingdom of Truth, that cannot be ≈øhaken, which is to continue to the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>How then did God deal with the re≈øt of the World?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Even they were for ≈øome con≈øiderable Spaces, in the fir≈øt Ages of the World, within the Advantages of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, by mixture with, or Neighbourhood to the Church, by Tradition from the Holy Patriarchs, which if they had faithfully ob≈øerved, together with the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Natures Light, it would have ≈øecured them in True Religion: Be≈øides, that they who were faithful in the≈øe, were on all proper occa≈øions provided for by the Faithful Creator (though they were not ≈øtrictly of that Seed) with immediate Revelations: But when all the≈øe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65165:183"/> were corrupted, as they were in the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, God withdrew him≈øelf by degrees, as the Glory did from the Temple in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> till there was nothing left but the Darkne≈øs of Tradition; fearfully debauch'd; fal≈øe Deductions from Nature's Light, and wor≈øe than that, the Devils Oracles in the room of Gods; ≈øo that there was in the generality of the Nations a ≈øecond and more de≈øperate Fall of Mankind from the true Religion, the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Church, and a ≈ømall Pro≈øelyti≈øme to that only excepted.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>What Examples are there of Gods continuing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to any parts of Mankind, out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, ju≈øtifying him, as not departing from men till they departed from him?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>How long did the Nations that de≈øerted God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue under that di≈ømal ob≈øcurity?</hi>

                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> In divers Ways and Manners, in more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Appearances, in Vi≈øions, Dreams, Prophe≈øies, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Illumination, by a Voice: In all which there were, when ever they were truly from God, ≈øuch mighty Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65165:184"/> of Divinity as over-ballanc'd all doubt: Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the≈øe, were the ordinary and familiar In≈øtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Patriarchs, and Holy Men, grounded upon Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Revealed Religion.</p>

                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Did God take any care for the ≈øecuring the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Truth given out by Revelation?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Yes, very early; how early we know not; but beyond Controver≈øie in the fir≈øt forming the <hi>Jewi≈øh</hi> Church into a ≈øetled Body, he began the more ≈øure and certain way of committing his Word and Will to Writing, and for the Honour of it, ≈øet the Copy with his own Hand, and continued it till the whole Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was compleat: Pa≈ø≈øant Revelation, or Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not being ≈øure enough.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Wherein is the Written Word more ≈øure than the Word in pa≈ø≈øing Revelation or Tradition?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The Word committed to Writing ≈øtands unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Divine Providence watching over what was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to keep it the ≈øame. All Covenants and Treaties, all Monuments of Knowledge have been thus ≈øecured, tran≈ømitted into all Parts, and con≈øigned to after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Appeals in Ca≈øes of doubt are more ≈øafely made to what is Written, and every one concerned has a ready and open way to Examine, and in all Ca≈øes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolved.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Have all Nations ≈øince the Days of the Ble≈ø≈øed Seed been Communicated with the≈øe Revelations?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> There hath been a Freedom given to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, and a Right in all Nations to demand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65165:184"/> the benefit of them granted by God and Chri≈øt to them, but there are many ≈øad Accounts to be given, why this Univer≈øal Grace to Mankind has not yet taken Effect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The unaccountablene≈øs of the Methods of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, in the Efficacies of his di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhing Goodne≈øs, even when things ≈øeem equally di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to the advantage of one, as of another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Experiment made upon ≈øo great a part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that have the Go≈øpel, ju≈øtifies God in not effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveying it to others, who would make as ill an u≈øe of it: The Idolatry Super≈øtition of ≈øome, the ≈øotti≈øh Ignorance, Sloath and neglect of others: The Cruelty and Barbarity exerci≈øed by Chri≈øtians upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the unan≈øwerable living to it in all Sects, make plain the great perver≈øene≈øs of our degenerate Nature, and how Nations that have not the Go≈øpel, would have abu≈øed it if they had had it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But e≈øpecially the great Enmity to, and Contempt of the Heavenly Doctrine, great Nations are inviron'd with, again≈øt the approaches of it, ≈øo far as it has come within their notice; as among <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> are a very obvious Rea≈øon, why they receive not the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Go≈øpels free promulgation.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>What then is the immediate Rea≈øon, why ≈øo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guide them, and the <hi>Jews</hi> that have the Scriptures of the Old Te≈øtament, have been the one great Enemies to all Scripture Revelations, and the other to the new Te≈øtament?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Becau≈øe Nations, that have the light of Nature, ≈øtay not them≈øelves upon that which is clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Divine and Publick in Natures Law, but either by unnatural Collections, and mi≈øerable wre≈øtings of its Principles, or flying to fal≈øe and dark Revelations, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them≈øelves in fal≈øhood, or mi≈øapplyed Truth: As to the <hi>Jews;</hi> it is very plain, they were bemi≈øted with the private Interpretation they had affixed to the Old Te≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65165:185"/> ≈øo that they could not ≈øee the clear, ea≈øie, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Trains of the ≈øame Publick and Divine, running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> but the Rudiments in the <hi>Old</hi> being more kind to the Cabal or Cypher of their ≈øelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øted Sen≈øe, they venerated them, and hated the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life in the <hi>New,</hi> that would not at all bear their privy Glo≈øs; although both Scriptures had the ≈øame Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials from Heaven, and carried the ≈øame Publick Sen≈øe: So great is the Delu≈øion of Private.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But how comes it to pa≈øs, that even among tho≈øe that enjoy the Light of the Go≈øpel, the Scriptures, and profe≈øs the ≈øame Chri≈øtianity, nay, the mo≈øt Refined and Reformed Chri≈øtianity, there are ≈øo great Differences and Divi≈øions?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> All proceeds from the ≈øame unhappy Spring; Men cannot endure to re≈øt in the Clear and Certain Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Truth, but by forc'd Additions, Mi≈øinterpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, violent Detor≈øions, for≈øake that which is Publick and Divine, for that which is Private, and their own; and are greatly offended, and too often enraged, that others do not concur with them.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>It ≈øeems then, the be≈øt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to re≈øt upon the mo≈øt undoubted Points of Truth, before we remove from them to any thing further?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is undoubtedly ≈øo; Religion, in all the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it, having ≈øuffered much more by forreign and di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Additions, than by wary Su≈øpen≈øions: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man keeps him≈øelf from Fal≈øe Religion; and ≈øtands ready and open to receive Truth.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But how then ≈øhould a Man make forward from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion to Revealed, or from what he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, to what he may in time come to ≈øee very good Proof for?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> By ≈øtaying the due time upon the Uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Doctrines and Commands of Natures Laws, yielding full Obedience to God in them, trembling to add any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65165:185"/> thing of ba≈øer Alloy to them. A Man ≈øhall ≈øee Revealed Truth ≈øhining out upon Natural, and joyning it ≈øelf to it, and with it. Thus many of the Fathers came over to Chri≈øtianity: And ≈øo in all parts of Scripture, by ri≈øing from the mo≈øt Fundamental Truths, lov'd and obey'd, a Man ≈øhall a≈øcend by due degrees to tho≈øe more remote. Thus Good Men in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament</hi> waited for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and upon ju≈øt Con≈øiderations moved upon the Line of Truth, from the State of Religion in the <hi>Old Te≈øtament,</hi> to that of the <hi>New;</hi> except ≈øometimes a Light ≈øhines ≈øuddenly round about Men, as in extraordinary Conver≈øions.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>You ≈øeem then to think, Fal≈øe Religion, and All Divi≈øions in the True, have mo≈øt nearly ≈øprung up from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence of Things, not of the Evidence of Publick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I do ≈øo indeed, although I know Mens not liking to retain Truth, but being bewitched by fal≈øe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betrays them both to the Plague of Lo≈øt and Fallen Spirits, warring under the Prince of our di≈øordered Air, <hi>the Ruler of the Darkne≈øs of this World,</hi> and to the various Arts of Men, who corrupt Religion for the Ends they have to ≈øerve them≈øelves of by it. I know Mens Faculties of Search, Inquiry into, and Comprehen≈øion of Truth, are much ≈øhrivell'd and ≈øhrunk up; I know Endle≈øs Doubts and Incertainties are brought upon Religion, by Darkne≈øs, and fal≈øe Appearances to Souls, that are ≈øo full of all the Rea≈øons and Cau≈øes of Delu≈øion within them≈øelves, and de≈øerted by the ju≈øt Judgment of God, giving them over to believe a Lie; I acknowledge all the≈øe Cau≈øes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: Yet I am a≈ø≈øured, the clo≈øe Adherence to God in Truths evidently Divine, and not removing farther into a Religious E≈øteem of Things, till upon the ≈øame Evidence, is the Means, under the Conduct of the Holy Spirit, to be ≈øecure from dangerous Errour or Schi≈øm from the true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65165:186"/> Publick: And whatever is not ≈øo evidently Publick and Divine, is liable to Private Interpretation, and ≈øo to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: And when Men are overweening upon Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, they ea≈øily fall into Errour; and when they are ≈øurly and ma≈øterly upon it, it moves Wrath, Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Strife; ≈øo that both Fal≈øhoood and Cruelty have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in at this Door, and rang'd over the World.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But ought we to ≈øtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Not ≈øo; but to behave our ≈øelves humbly, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øtly; to acknowledge there are va≈øt Tracts of Truth and Knowledge beyond what we know; but we mu≈øt feel the Evidence of them, before we can receive them: yet to carry our ≈øelves with due conce≈ø≈øion to every Mans Sen≈øe, that though their Sen≈øe cannot, nor ought to ma≈øter us, no more ought we to expect ours ≈øhould them: which would exceedingly reconcile or abate Differences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench the mi≈øchievous Effects the World hath ≈øo long groan'd under by ≈øo many Religions of Nations, Names of Churches, and Per≈øons propagating their Private, that is, not Divine Sen≈øe, and that with Clamour, and too often with rude Force.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>What are the In≈øtances of the Mi≈øchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, Divine Truth, for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sen≈øe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The Angels Fall from Heaven was certainly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Private Sen≈øe and Intere≈øt; <hi>Adam</hi>'s from Innocency and Paradi≈øe, upon the ≈øame; the <hi>Jews</hi> Fall from being the Church and People of God, was upon the Idioti≈øm of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Religion for their own: All Idolatry and Super≈øtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Heathens</hi> have ri≈øen from hence: All the Here≈øies in the Church have come from an over-love to Private Opinion. This is the mo≈øt damnable Antichri≈øtiani≈øm of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make its Private, Catholick. All Per≈øecutions of Heathens, <hi>Romes Inqui≈øition,</hi> and Ma≈ø≈øacres, have been

                     <p>In other things, wherein they could not look round about them, nor fully comprehend what the Spirit in them did ≈øignifie, though they convey'd it to After-times, yet they were by Almighty Impre≈ø≈øions upon all their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties nece≈ø≈øary to that Service, held in ≈øtronger than Adamantine Con≈øinements, that they could not extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Divine Truths.

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> The≈øe Proofs of the Doctrine and Divine De≈øcent of Scripture, are undoubtedly of the highe≈øt Account that any Created Te≈øtimony can be, and are a down-weight of Proof to all ≈øober Rea≈øon: Yet that they can ri≈øe above the Value of <hi>John Bapti≈øt</hi>'s Te≈øtimony to <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> I cannot find; and therefore we mu≈øt remove higher to the Doctrines that tho≈øe Holy Men preach'd and writ, the ≈øpiritual Wi≈ødom and admirable Contexture they us'd in Writing, the Works they did, carrying the Evidences of Divinity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves, and applied by the Holy Spirit to the Sen≈øes of true Believers, with its own a≈ø≈øuring Atte≈øtations, and gracious Operations: of which, all that was but created is no more than the Tube, Pipe, or Channel of Conveyance, if we enter it into a compare with what is Higher and Divine.</p>
                     <p>But if the la≈øt Re≈øolution of Proof were into any thing Humane, there might be mi≈øtake in that; for Humane at its highe≈øt elevation is but Created, and Created is not firm and ≈øure enough for a Foundation, nor can it rai≈øe an A≈ø≈øent noble and generous enough for a Faith in that which is Divine. All that can be ≈øummon'd, may be an outward Fortification or Introduction; but the Rock of Truth is the Son of God, Divinity it ≈øelf: Upon this <hi>the Church is built, that the Gates of Hell cannot prevail again≈øt it.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> There are ≈øome Parts of Scripture that are but Mini≈øterial, and almo≈øt Servile, in compari≈øon of others. And that the≈øe are found in all Authentick Copies, and have been delivered down from Age to Age with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65165:191"/> Rolls, may depend more upon Humane Te≈øtimony, e≈øpecially where the Connexion with the more Divine Parts is not evident: For the≈øe being but as the Body, and ≈øome of them of the more remote Parts from the Soul of Scripture, cannot ≈øparkle that Divine Light and Heat the Spirit of Scripture does, and ≈øo may ≈øtand in need of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Light from the Superiour Luminaries of Sacred Truth, and in many Ca≈øes may, like the Moon, need Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of Light from our very Earth; but the Sun of Scripture receives the Highe≈øt Te≈øtimony, by the ≈øtronge≈øt Reflexions of its own Original Beams.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>How comes it to pa≈øs, that there are ≈øuch different Degrees of Scripture-Excellency in the ≈øeveral Parts of it, and that it is not one Even Form of Doctrine, methodically laid together, and of the ≈øame Tenour of Di≈øcour≈øe.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> In this ≈øeeming Di≈øorder appears the great Wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Maje≈øty of Divine Contrivance, that without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging it ≈øelf to the low and even pedantick Laws of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Di≈øcour≈øe, it rai≈øes ≈øo great a Record of Truth upon variety of Occa≈øions, and by an Infinite Fore≈øight prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to it ≈øelf the ≈øeveral Mea≈øures and Ends of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, rai≈øes them out of a great variety of Accidents, and in ≈øuch an Order as ≈øeem'd be≈øt to it ≈øelf for tho≈øe Ends, ≈øo as to give ea≈øie and ready Advantages to him that runs to read, and gather In≈øtructions of weightie≈øt moment, and al≈øo of quicke≈øt and ≈øuddene≈øt ≈øally upon his Mind, of greate≈øt aptne≈øs to fix upon the Memory without loading it, and yet in the mean time to lay the Obligations of all Degrees of Search and Diligence to join one part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to another, ≈øo as to comprehend the whole Complex of Divine Doctrine, and extract the Order of Hi≈øtory. For by a mo≈øt natural, free, and unaffected occa≈øional way, all Truths to make <hi>wi≈øe to Salvation,</hi> and a complete Sum of all Goodne≈øs, is to be found in Scripture, with infinite Varieties of Addre≈øs, all the ways po≈ø≈øible, to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding,

                     <p>Now from this Supreme Di≈øpo≈øe of all things to the Ends of God in Scripture, out of ≈øuch a variety of Emergencies of all ≈øorts, ari≈øes ≈øuch a diver≈øity of ≈øeveral Excellencies in the Parts of Scripture, that yet all meet in that Great Center of the Glory of God, in a Communication of his Coun≈øels concerning Man, and that turn round tho≈øe Two Globes, that little one of the pre≈øent World, a Point like this Earth, and the other that va≈øt Circumference of Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But is there not as great a difference ari≈øing from the various States and Conditions of the Writers of Scripture, and the ≈øo different Periods of Time they were upon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> That there is, and mu≈øt needs be a difference, is undeniable; yet, to the great Glory of Scripture, and a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurance it is from God, even tho≈øe ≈ømalle≈øt and lowe≈øt things la≈øt ≈øpoken of are all treated with all the Purity, Gravity, becoming the Penmen of the Holy Spirit, and with all the U≈øefulne≈øs their Nature can extend to; Even ≈øo the Holy Men u≈øed by God in this Service, how vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and differing ≈øoever in their ≈øeveral Ages and Times of writing, in their Circum≈øtances of State and Condition in this World, High, Low, Rich, Poor, Learned, Unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how di≈øtant ≈øoever in their Times of Writing, in the outward Forms and Modes of their Wor≈øhip of God, in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65165:192"/> Things that fell under their Account and Relation, before the Law, under the Law, in the Days of the <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> after his Death; yet there is the ≈øame Spirit, Scope, Cha≈øtne≈øs of Style, Maje≈øty, and Authority in the Contexture; one A≈øpect upon the Glory of God, Obedience to him, De≈øire of his Favour, as the whole Happine≈øs of Man; the ≈øame Reflexions upon the great Evil of Sin, and the con≈øequent Mi≈øery, and even of their own Sins: So that where any Combination, or Conference to concert things, was impo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, yet there is ≈øuch an Union without a ≈øet Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a≈ø≈øures the One Hand of the Divine Spirit and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon All.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Is not the Church of God the Tru≈øtee and Depo≈øito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Sacred Oracles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is ≈øo in Divine Ordination, and the general Cour≈øe of Providence; but yet it adds nothing to them, but receives all from them. The Church is known to be the Church by the Scriptures, not the Scriptures by the Church, except declaratorily only. The Church is the Pillar and Re≈øt of Scriptures, where God is pleas'd to fix them, that they may be expo≈øed to Publick View; but their Authority is of God, evident in them≈øelves.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Knowledge of Religion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> A very great Favour it is of God, that when he writes up the People, he counts that we were born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his True Church, where all the Springs of Salvation run: but as to the Proof of Religion, or the Records of it, it can be no more than a Private Proof: For, till we make a true Judgment, by what is Divine and Publick, and of God in the true Church, it does no more than equal other Societies walking with Confidence and A≈ø≈øurance, with great Awes and Devotion, in the Name of their God, in the Profe≈ø≈øion of their Religion. Till therefore there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65165:193"/> is a Trial of every Religion, and the Records of it, all ≈øuch Societies are upon the ≈øame Level. When the Religion, and Oracles of every Religion, come to be tried, and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, the Church of God ri≈øes to Heaven, and all el≈øe, except ≈øo far as they joyn in any Parts of the ≈øame Truth, ≈øink down beneath.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt: <hi>But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Te≈øtimony of the Church? or, that we have all the Books of it, but by the ≈øame Te≈øtimony?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> That the Books we own for Scripture are Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all of them ≈øo, ari≈øes to our A≈ø≈øurance by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ≈øame Divine Spirit of Truth running through one, as does through another: For, upon this account the True Church received them, when fir≈øt received, and ≈øo tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, making the ≈øame Judgment ≈øucce≈ø≈øively in the ≈øeveral Ages, as the fir≈øt did, the ≈øame Rea≈øon always continuing. What is be≈øides this, is to be attributed to the Di≈øcerning of Spirits in all the Times while Scripture was writing, by the due Exerci≈øe of which True Scripture was received, and all other ≈øhut out: for, the Writings of Prophets was ≈øubject to Prophets, and by them enroll'd into Scriptures. That we have the ≈øame Scripture ju≈øtly and faithfully con≈øigned over to us from Age to Age, is to be own'd and acknowledg'd to Divine Providence watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his Church and Oracles together, and conveying to us by the ordinary Security of the Churches Te≈øtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the <hi>Precious</hi> di≈øtingui≈øh'd not only <hi>from the Vile,</hi> but from the <hi>le≈øs Precious</hi> al≈øo: but yet we mu≈øt have greater Te≈øtimony than this, as hath been already urged.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>But how could we be a≈ø≈øured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches Te≈øtimony?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Finding ≈øo much Divine, and no more of the ≈øame ≈øtamp in the World, we may be concluded that way, and abundantly ≈øatisfied, that God will accept us in our Faith and Obedience to ≈øo great a Revelation. When any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65165:193"/> of Divine Truth hath been adhered to ≈øincerely, the Danger hath always been greater in lo≈øing True Religion by corrupt Additions; and the injurious Refu≈øals of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revelation come to pa≈øs more through the Prejudices of that Corruption, than by humble and mode≈øt Su≈øpen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till God hath a≈ø≈øured us of his further Revelations. But be≈øides this, we may ea≈øily find, we mu≈øt needs have the whole Globe of Truth, and the Horizon of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel gives us the whole Heaven or Kingdom of it, as it is admini≈øtred in this World; ≈øo that all further Degrees of Light, and Di≈øcoveries of it, ≈øhall be but greater Clearne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes of what we already have in the main and Sub≈øtance: For, if even the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> though it made ≈øo great a change, did but thus compleat and illu≈øtrate Chri≈øt <hi>ye≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and to day the ≈øame,</hi> how much more may we be a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who have the <hi>New</hi> it ≈øelf, ≈øo much excelling the <hi>Old,</hi> as it every where a≈ø≈øures us? So that we can expect a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi> or the <hi>New Hieru≈øalem</hi> on Earth, only for the highe≈øt Exaltation of what we now have, till we come to Heaven it ≈øelf.</p>
                     <p>Que≈øt. <hi>Do the various Readings, ≈øo often bandied by Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, make no Abatement from the Certainty of Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Tho≈øe various Readings are ≈øuch as excite and quicken Search, and yet cannot di≈øtract the Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to alter the Scope, Coherence, and De≈øign of the Context, much le≈øs to change the Analogie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in other Places: While therefore they do not that, they take away the ≈øu≈øpicion of Con≈øpiracy, they pre≈øerve from greater Corruptions, by turning the Eyes of Men to look every way; they ≈øhew how many excellent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes dwell near the Divine Writing, and the Bad are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øtly enough thrown off: For in main things there is ≈øo much repeated, and ≈øaid over again and again, as that all ≈øuch Truths may be fully pre≈øented and a≈ø≈øured, and yet not ≈øo much be ≈øaid, as might be ≈øaid of the ≈øame kind,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65165:194"/> without any Tautology; for the Subjects are ≈øo rich, that even the World would be over-charg'd, and <hi>not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Books that would be written. Amen.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65165:207"/> been ≈øpoken, the Writings of the Fathers are ≈øo Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as not to be read over by the mo≈øt; ≈øo doubtful in their Genuine≈øs, that they cannot be Examined, but with great Labour, and well prepared Judgment; ≈øo di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable in their ≈øen≈øe, that to attain a certainty in it, would cut off Time from the greater Imployment of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in the Word of God, day and night, where Men's Callings lie otherwi≈øe; ≈øo that to receive our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from hence were of too remote an a≈ø≈øurance to any one, much more to tho≈øe who have not Books, and ≈øtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for their Profe≈ø≈øion: But every Man, whether learned or unlearned, is concerned deeply to try his Religion with his own Eyes, and not anothers for him; and God hath therefore provided a Word nigh him, even in his Mouth, and in his Heart; and hath al≈øo taken care by ≈øtirring up ≈øo many both of the Ancient and Modern Chri≈øtians, to ≈øeparate them≈øelves to intermeddle with all ≈øacred knowledge, that there is a worthy exerci≈øe of the learned World herein, and great advantages ari≈øe thereby for univer≈øal knowledge even to the le≈øs learned, and the very unlearned.</p>

                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> It is mo≈øt evident, as hath been already affirmed, they put a greate≈øt difference betwixt the mo≈øt excellent Monuments of Chri≈øtianity, that were but Humane<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> whether their own, or others, and in≈øpired Pages; el≈øe <hi>Clement, Ignatius,</hi> and others, might as well have been Canoniz'd by them, as what is from them come down to us for Sacred Canon it ≈øelf; and even as they did, we may ≈øee the great odds betwixt the one and the other; and as we adore God the ≈øupreme Author, ≈øo the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Pre≈øerver of Scripture, who by Divine Evidences, and by ≈øuperintending Providence, hath divided the bound of Scripture at ≈øo great a remove from all the Writings
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65165:208"/> in the World, whether Chri≈øtian or Prophane, the Apocryphal Books not excepted, which though too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturou≈øly joyn'd ≈øo generally in a Volume with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet are evidently di≈øproportioned in the Maje≈øty of Sen≈øe, and Divine Eloquence.</p>

                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> Give them all the advantages that can be given, and either we mu≈øt ≈øay, they are Infallibly guided, and then we mu≈øt receive their Decrees, as Scripture, and they mu≈øt be atte≈øted to us, as Scripture is atte≈øted; or they are not Infallibly guided, and then their Decrees mu≈øt be tryed, as all Fallibles ought to be, by a Rule ≈øurer than them≈øelves: If even Divine Revelation it ≈øelf was at fir≈øt tryed, and found perfect; nay, if even all that God propo≈øes to us, as from him≈øelf, comes laden with its own proper Evidences, how much more mu≈øt that which is confe≈ø≈øedly humane, be tryed by that which is confe≈ø≈øedly Divine? The great u≈øe of Councils is therefore ≈øo to debate, and bring things to a Re≈øult, by a confluence of Wi≈ødom and Learning, that we may ≈øee Divine Truths in their own Light, in Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to hold out which they are but mini≈øterially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and not to impo≈øe upon any under the name of Publick; for that alone is Publick, that is Divine: All
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65165:208"/> Compari≈øon of Privates among them≈øelves, mu≈øt needs be lo≈øt in this Publick, before which the greate≈øt name of Publick, <hi>is but as the drop of the Bucket, and the ≈ømall du≈øt of the Ballance:</hi> And the union with that true Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick makes the mo≈øt Private a Publick; and Separation from it, the mo≈øt ≈øeemingly Publick, a mo≈øt Idiottal Private.</p>
                     <p>And it were very happy, if the Experiment hereof were not too evident in the Councils that have been, how little Number of it ≈øelf can Contribute to truly Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or Divine; yet the fitne≈øs of the Means is withall to be acknowledged, as ordain'd by God.</p>

                        <hi>An≈øw.</hi> God, the mo≈øt High Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øour and Owner of Heaven and Earth, places his Court, Family, and particular Re≈øidence where he plea≈øes; and he hath cho≈øen the Church to be this to him. <hi>This is my Re≈øt, here will I dwell for ever, for I have de≈øired it. Heaven is my Throne, Earth is my Foot≈øtool; where is the Hou≈øe you will build me? To this Man will I look, that trembles at my Word.</hi> And where God dwells, there he manife≈øts him≈øelf: As a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter of a Family makes known in his Hou≈øe and Family his Nature, Will, Laws, and Government; ≈øo God does in his Church: <hi>In</hi> Judah <hi>is God known, his Name is great in</hi> I≈ørael. In his Church he ≈øhews <hi>the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> expects and rewards Services, as a Great Ma≈øter, and makes known his Di≈ølikes and Di≈øplea≈øure. This is brought to pa≈øs in the Church by tho≈øe many Ways that God hath of bringing his Word to any Places or Per≈øons, giving it Reception among them, and then ≈øtirring up his Children and Servants to hear his Voice, to ≈øearch his Mind and Will, and to under≈øtand it; ≈øo that it is as a Voice continually behind them. In his Temple there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his Hou≈øe, every one mu≈øt needs ≈øpeak of his Glory: His Word cannot lie ≈øtill, for all are concerned to meditate, ponder, inquire, and di≈øcour≈øe of it, and are by Supreme Management excited ≈øo to do; and ≈øo much as this Exerci≈øe in his Word is by any means depre≈ø≈øed, ≈øo far God is withdrawn, and the Excellency of the Church-≈øtate lo≈øt. Now of the Church being the <hi>Hou≈øe of God,</hi> there was this great Type: God dwelt in the Temple at <hi>Jeru≈øalem,</hi> as in a Palace; there was ≈øuch a Diet of Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, changed every day; of Sacrifices of all ≈øorts; ≈øuch Perfumes of Incen≈øe and Odours, ≈øuch Officers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants attending continually, ≈øuch Re≈øorts of the whole Body of the People to the Court of this Great King and Princely Hou≈øholder. Together with this State, runs along in a mighty Stream, <hi>Gods ≈øhewing his Word to Jacob,</hi>

                        <hi>his Statutes and Judgments to I≈ørael.</hi> In the <hi>New Te≈øtament,</hi> the Pomp and Ceremonial Part is wholly transferred into Spirituality; but Spirituality is not lower, but higher in the Sub≈øtance of all that could be figured by the≈øe things: and the ≈øub≈øtantial part of that State, the Communication of the Word of God, is much exalted in the true Chri≈øtian Church, that the Light of One Day is now as much as the Light of Seven was before.

The True Church then may be ≈øtiled a <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> in the highe≈øt Sen≈øe, if rightly under≈øtood; that is, Truth it ≈øelf, that is the unmovable Pillar and everla≈øting Foundation, hath ≈øo clo≈øely banded the Church with it ≈øelf, that it is One Pillar and Foundation with it.

After the Apo≈øtles, there was but a Gradual Ce≈ø≈øation of Apo≈øtolick Men, Men of Eminent Graces and Extraordinary Gifts, though not of the Infallible Guidance of the Divine Spirit for the Revelation of the Go≈øpel, or the writing of Scripture; yet of more immediate Divine A≈ø≈øi≈øtances, in re≈øemblance of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for the Confirmation of the Churches planted by the Apo≈øtles, Supervi≈øal over them, and Care for them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo for the further propagation of Chri≈øtianity, which being but newly ≈øet out, had not arrived many places, where it was to come, and ≈øo needed ≈øome more than ordinary A≈ø≈øi≈øtances: Even as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did not immediately Cea≈øe, no more did the≈øe Per≈øona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges extraordinary in their Endowments: Such as the≈øe were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in a Degree of Superiority over tho≈øe that had not the ≈øame miraculous Inablements, nor Knowledge as yet in Chri≈øtianity.

                     <p>He that excels in his Knowledge of, Obedience to, Zeal for, and Authority in the Word of God, ≈øeeing that Word conveys all this kind of Power from it ≈øelf, mu≈øt needs have more of that kind of Power ≈øo conveyed than others; for the more purely this Word is under≈øtood and Preached, the more Power goes out of it, and along with tho≈øe that di≈øplay it, and ≈øo they become Pa≈øtors of a higher Character, whether of a higher Order, or not.</p>

But in things neither Commanded, nor Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, if Con≈øcience be apprehen≈øive of danger any way, this is the Honour and Dignity that God hath conferred upon Con≈øcience, as his immediate Vicegerent in the Soul, and carrying his Authority, (by always pre≈øenting it in his Word, and Command,) that a Man ≈øhould ≈øu≈øpend his Action, wherein Con≈øcience is not ≈øatisfied, and at re≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Goodne≈øs of the Action; and this is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which tho≈øe that are above, either in their Authority in the Church, or the ≈øtrength of their Under≈øtanding, Gifts, or Graces, ≈øhould be≈øtow upon tho≈øe that are below, that they ≈øhould not either by their Authority, Influence, or Example, Scandali≈øe the little ones, or the weak, that are ≈øo, either in regard of their low Station, or the weakne≈øs of their Gifts, and Graces, that is, draw them into the Sin of doing any thing, of which Con≈øcience hath a mi≈øtru≈øt of di≈øplea≈øing God in ≈øo doing, in regard, that it both weakens, and di≈øables Con≈øcience in the di≈øcharge of that Tru≈øt repo≈øed in it, for the carrying on the Soul in a Chri≈øtian Cour≈øe, its Authority being violated, and pro≈øtrated in the reverence due to it, and di≈øturbs the Peace and Comfort it ought to Mini≈øter to the Soul in that Cour≈øe: For by this ≈øort of Scandal, the Apo≈øtle Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øes, the Weak Chri≈øtian falls into Sin, his Con≈øcience is defiled, is wounded, is grieved, is made weak: All the mi≈øchief of which, the value of indifferent things is not ≈øuch, as that it can an≈øwer, and make recompen≈øe for; and ≈øo to ≈øin thus again≈øt the weak, is to de≈øtroy them for whom Chri≈øt died, and therefore to ≈øin again≈øt Chri≈øt; which is the rea≈øon of tho≈øe weighty Di≈øcour≈øes of our Saviour again≈øt Scandal, <hi>Mark</hi> 18. and of the Apo≈øtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and 1 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 8. and <hi>cap.</hi> 10. which being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, give great light one to another.</p>

                     <p>As then Number and Mea≈øure are means Ordained for Humane Nature, and principal In≈øtruments of Rea≈øon, to come to the mo≈øt certain knowledge of things, and to be ≈øecured, they are, and continue what they ju≈øtly ought to be; ≈øo True Religion is thereupon pre≈øented to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der exact Number and Mea≈øure, falling in one with another, the Number Twelve multiplied into a Square Cube of Twelve thou≈øand Furlongs.</p>

In the Sacred Maps, the Chri≈øtians of <hi>Achaia,</hi> were <hi>Achaia</hi> it ≈øelf: The <hi>Seven Churches of</hi> A≈øia, were the Cities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves: And whatever Le≈ø≈øer Differences, or Divi≈øions, this or that Name of Di≈øtinction may ≈øeem to make in National Religion, yet, the True Sub≈øtantial Religion in all of them ≈øhall be one National Religion; and become one <hi>Rod</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> in the Hand of Chri≈øt, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be as one National Tribe, and Church: For let Men do what they can again≈øt it, True Religion, as it is the only Publick Religion, and no Separation of Men from it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever called Publick, can make it Private; ≈øo in what place ≈øoever it is, it ≈øhall have the mo≈øt Publick Character, and the True Religion in all tho≈øe that ≈øincerely profe≈øs it, ≈øhall be one True Publick Religion, and tho≈øe little Differences ≈øhall not cleave it into more than one. Without the Change of True Religion it ≈øelf, there cannot be a Schi≈øm of a deeper Sen≈øe in it; if Bitterne≈øs and Animo≈øity, Cen≈øoriou≈øne≈øs, and the Per≈øecuting Spirit were away: God will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciou≈øly Interpret Scruples on one ≈øide to a Jealou≈øie for the Purity of Religion, the freedom of the other to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire to Propagate it under the favour of Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be capable of doing mo≈øt Good. In Heaven they now are all one, and ≈øhall be one, and the Envy, Strife, and Contention (which the Good Lord Pardon) ≈øhall be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aboli≈øhed. This is the Honour of True Religion, of Publick Divine Religion.</p>
