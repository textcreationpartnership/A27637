            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>I Have very ſadly obſerved the great diſtreſs of Humane Affairs, through miſcarriages e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way in point of Religion.</p>
            <p>For while the Powers of this world and Eccleſiaſtick Juriſdictions take it for their Right, to impoſe by ſevere Penalties, and dreadful Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, what they think fit under ſo great a name; they yet neither can aſſure any one, they are not, or do not uſe to be miſtaken in their recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations; or that all their Authority or Power ſhall excuſe and acquit thoſe that obey them, when they appear before <hi>Gods Tribunal;</hi> ſo that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Judgment or Conſcience ſhould have any repoſe here.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, ſome not only out of Recoyl for ſelf-preſervation, or out of deſign, but from Furious Wild Principles, have broken out into publick diſturbance, to make room for what they have proclaim'd, as the Kingdom of God and Chriſt, to the great ſcandal of True Religion, the imbrewing their hands very horridly in Blood, and the ſeeming Juſtification of utmoſt Rigors, againſt
<pb facs="tcp:65165:3"/> any pretences of Religion, except according to Law.</p>
            <p>Beſides all this, private Feuds and Animoſities, vehement and angry diſputes, are every where cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous, and people hereupon in great Amuſe, what they ſhould believe or do.</p>
            <p>Now ſince there is no doubt, all theſe evils are foreſeen by God; there is as little doubt, that there are ſure Remedies provided againſt them.</p>
            <p>I have then upon the whole this account to give the Reader.</p>
            <p>That the obſervation of ſo many Counter-Cries of Opinion, ſuch great Exaſperations in mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſuch Complaints of oppreſſion of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by undue Laws, ſuch Recriminations of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Sedition, Fanaticiſm, not only among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but among Proteſtant Chriſtians, and of the ſame Common National Intereſt, mov'd me to ſeek Retirement to ſome <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Certainty,</hi> that I might be at <hi>perfect Peace upon,</hi> in full ſatisfaction of Judgment and compoſure of Affection: and having found <hi>Natural Religion</hi> as certain as our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental Chriſtianity,</hi> in moſt things of the ſame immediate certainty as Natural; in all things after due exploration, of the ſame final cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, I am ſo far at Peace in my Judgment, as to have no doubt <hi>WHAT IS TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH</hi> in relation to Eternal Happineſs, if <hi>ten thouſand more of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65165:3"/> encompaſſed me round about; ſo far at Peace in my Affections, as not to be in Commotion with any man that gives Teſtimony to Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he is a ſtrict obſerver of Natural Religion, and Fundamental Chriſtianity; one Eſſential Rule of both which is, <hi>Love, Peace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> to all that are centred in this Natural Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they may adjoyn or refuſe ſome Eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick <hi>Placits</hi> that do not harm the Foundation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I am aſſur'd this very Natural Religion eſpouſed by Chriſtianity, well conſidered and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, would diſarm the world of thoſe Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cruelty in the Cauſe of Religion, ſo extreamly abhored by it; whether uſed by angry ſupreme Powers, or unjuſtly taken up by Seditious, Ambitious or Fanatick Subjects. Which Cruelty men are ſain to borrow from wild Beaſts, no ſuch being given by the Gracious Author of all things to ſo excellent a Nature as he made the <hi>Humane,</hi> and therefore moſt certainly not by the Redeemer, nor his Religion, who came to fill the world with Innocency, Goodneſs and Peace, after ſo great an Invaſion of Barbarity and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>Now having found this ſatisfaction my ſelf, I make offer of it, if it may be the ſame to others, asking only Candid Interpretation in particular management, the main Principle being above the need of pardon or the Fear of Indignation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:65165:4"/>
            <p> Although the Diſcourſe (being intended much ſhorter) is not diſtinguiſhed in the Body of it into Chapters or otherwiſe; yet that the Reader may have a guidance into the main Deſigns of it, I have prefixed this Summary of Heads of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe following each other.</p>

                  <p>However we expound either of theſe, they are both alike to the diſcourſe intended; it being undoubted that Chriſtani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alwaies lays the grounds and reaſons, gives the commands, and urges the precepts, inſpires the temper here deſcrib'd, and doth moſt effectively in all times upon many, (though few comparatively) and in all reaſonable hope ſhall upon the generality in ſome time ſo prevail in the world, that all that Belluine, Ferocious, and Salvage Temper of men ſhall be put off, and proſcribed the world; the hearts of men being either truly chang'd by the Grace of God, or univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally ſo far convinced by high conſiderations and over com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming light <hi>(for the knowledg of the Lord ſhall cover the earth, as waters do the ſea);</hi> that at leaſt they will not diſcover that <hi>Leonine,</hi> and <hi>Wolviſh Temper;</hi> that cruelty and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome ſo natural to mens hearts in this ſinful and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate.</p>
                  <p>And this extends not only to the ſuperſeding the <hi>cruelty of action, oppreſſion, ſpoyling of goods, impriſonment, Maſſacres, martyrdoms,</hi> and all ſort of <hi>Tortures;</hi> but to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that <hi>poyſon of Aſps</hi> that is in mens lips, <hi>the Lyon-like teeth</hi> of ſlanders, and invective, the <hi>ſwords</hi> and <hi>knives</hi> of <hi>cruel mockings</hi> and <hi>Revilings</hi> men offer one to another in the management of Religious Controverſies.</p>
                  <p>For theſe things the Prophet ſpeaks of, are eſpecially to be underſtood with reſpect to Religion, as men are upon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:6"/> their hatred to true Religion, or the mutual differences in it, become <hi>Lions, Leopards,</hi> and <hi>Tygers</hi> in their executions; <hi>Cockatrices, Aſpes,</hi> and <hi>Scorpions</hi> in their <hi>bitter words</hi> and <hi>Anathema's.</hi> All which according to the influences of Chriſtianity upon mens minds declared in this <hi>Prophecy,</hi> ſhall be taken out of the world; except upon the account of thoſe things alone, which will be cauſes of mens <hi>eternal damnation</hi> at the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and Chriſt, if the inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be Spiritual; or ſuch <hi>iniquities</hi> as God hath indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be puniſhed by a <hi>Judg</hi> in this world, if the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be temporal. Of ſuch a change as is here ſet out, the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> was a great and remarkable inſtance, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion as it hath been thought a <hi>prophetic</hi> Pattern of the calling of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo (it may be as well thought) of this happy tranſmutation of the world, moſt probably concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent with it, if either be univerſal, as we have reaſon to hope; for he was taken in the very manner of a <hi>fierce and wild beaſt</hi> breathing <hi>out threatnings,</hi> and <hi>ſlaughter</hi> againſt <hi>the Diſciples of the Lord,</hi> and immediately <note place="margin">Acts 9. 1.</note> turned into a meek, merciful, tender, and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Lamb,</hi> over whom at his converſion there <hi>ſhone a light round about</hi> him, in reſemblance of this <hi>knowledg of the Lord that ſhall cover the earth;</hi> at the <hi>brightneſs</hi> of which they that <hi>journeyed</hi> with him, <hi>ſtood ſpeechleſs,</hi> which might allegorize the making tame even thoſe in ſuch a day of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Appearance that are no true Converts.</p>
                  <p>Now this Apoſtle (as we know) ever after breath'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>Love, Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>gentleneſs of Chriſt,</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and offers in all his writings to inſpire it into others, as we ſhall have abundant occaſion in the progreſs of this diſcourſe to obſerve; ſevere in nothing, but what was irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable with this excellent Chriſtian ſpirit.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this, we may eaſily perceive our Saviour in this place ſpeaks neither his own intention and deſign, nor the proper tendency and rational effect of his Doctrine; for in that ſenſe he ſaith to his Diſciples, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to imitate the <hi>fiery zealot ſpirit, Ye know not what ſpirit ye are of:</hi> for the Son of man comes not in a Chariot of fire to deſtroy all that will not be of his Religion; for he came not to <hi>deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them,</hi> Luk. 9. 55, 56.</p>
                     <p>In this place therefore, he only ſignifies what would ariſe through the great Corruption of man, whoſe luſts and paſſions would be apt to ſwell and rage at ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Doctrine, ſo deſtructive to ſin, and to all falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, defended by long poſſeſſion, and ancient Tradition, and compoſed for the Patronage of mens luſts.

Indeed the prophane, and enemies of Chriſtianity, are wont to cry out againſt Religion on ſuch occaſions, as if it wrought all the miſchief in ſuch caſes, when it is their own wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that <hi>troubles things;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The fooliſhneſs of man perverteth his way, and then his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This then abates nothing from the grand Importance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65165:7"/> of theſe words, which I ſhall endeavour ſo to diſcourſe, as to ſhew that Chriſtianity lays down thoſe Foundations of Unity, Peace and Kindneſs upon Religious Accounts, as are ſufficient in the Nature and Reaſon of them to take off all manner of Barbarity, Fierceneſs and Malignity in actions and words concerning Differences in Religion; ſo that there ſhould be no <hi>hurting</hi> and <hi>deſtroying,</hi> but what is juſt, and deſerved puniſhment of evil; Evil truly and really ſo, and not different Religions only, without that natural real evil, much leſs different apprehenſions in the ſame Religion, almoſt, if not altogether unavoidable; nor ſhould the names of Contumacy, Faction, Sedition, be a ſalvo, or ſhelter ſufficient for men to cover their Cruelties under, directed indeed againſt different ſenſe in Religion, whatever elſe they pretend.</p>
                     <p>And if the true meaſures given us by the Goſpel were obſerved and purſued, they would certainly and effectively reconcile mankind in general, and Chriſtians among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in particular, removing all Animoſities, and making them moſt tender, compaſſionate and benign one towards another, even towards them that are not yet come to the knowledg of the Chriſtian Truth, much more to them that profeſs that Truth with themſelves, though they diſſent in ſome things, wherein they are taught by their profeſſion to do it with modeſty, <hi>eſteeming and preferring one another</hi> in <hi>honour each</hi> above <hi>themſelves,</hi> even then when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in their particular diſtant ſentiments part with that they are perſwaded is Truth.

                     <p>I would therefore by divine Aſſiſtance endeavour ſo to manage this Diſcourſe, as to ſecure it from ſuch eluſion. I confeſs the undertaking, as it is of great moment, ſo is very difficult; and whoever conſiders what hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been done in the world, and how things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have been intangled and perplexed, would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there ſhould be any ſuch Rules of prevention in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that God hath deſign'd any ſuch for the good of mankind, and by meaſuring from what is paſt to future expectation, may look upon any Diſcourſe to ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian</hi> and Imaginary. Seeing the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſo humble, peaceable, modeſt and amicable, and that hath the only true Rules of this Peace, hath yet been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful herein, that as at the firſt it was the <hi>Butt</hi> againſt which all ſorts of Cruelty and Barbarity diſcharg'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the <hi>Confeſſors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> of it; ſo ſince, it hath been made the ſeat of thoſe <hi>unholy holy Wars, perpetual Controverſies</hi> and <hi>Diſputes</hi> carried on with <hi>great wrath and clamour;</hi> and worſe than that, a kind of <hi>Aceldama,</hi> or <hi>Field of blood,</hi> by the horrid and unnatural furies of Chriſtians one againſt another.</p>
                     <p>But to conclude from hence, True Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity hath not a fitneſs, or leſs of fitneſs, than falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to beget in mens minds that Amity, Union, and Peace ſpoken of, by fixing ſuch principles and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65165:8"/> as Chriſtians might concenter upon, notwithſtanding their various ſenſes in many things; and by induing them with ſuch a <hi>ſpirit of wiſdom as is pure, peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits,</hi> is to take off the load from the Degeneracy and Corruption of humane nature, and to charge it upon the moſt excellent thing in the world, <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> whoſe very Excellency is the true and only reaſon why Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the malice of Hell planted themſelves againſt it with all the force they could to have bar'd it out of the world; and when it prevailed againſt thoſe <hi>Gates of Hell,</hi> and ſetled it ſelf, then to <hi>adulterate, debauch</hi> and <hi>divide</hi> it; which attempts, and the reſiſtance to them, hath made it fuller of commotion and noiſe, than falſe Religion; which being held in peace by Sin and Satan, as their intire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided Territory (no ſound of true Religion coming in), there is not that reaſon for a diſturbance.</p>
                     <p>There is therefore no Argument of moment to be drawn from hence againſt the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> or <hi>Reformed Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> from the diviſions of the Teachers and Profeſſors of it; for it being demonſtrated (as it may very plainly be) that it is not from the nature of Religion it ſelf; it then remains, it is only from the pravity of men, and deſign of <hi>Satan,</hi> who are not ſo concern'd againſt any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not feeling that deſtruction from any but it. Thus therefore the waves and ſtorms beat more vehemently againſt the Rock of Truth; that there is more rage, and foam, and froth about it is not from the unquietneſs of the Rock, which is always firm and ſtill, but from the unruli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the waves.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the <hi>dead Sea</hi> of a <hi>falſe Religion,</hi> or a <hi>total Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in Religion, becauſe it hath a <hi>dead calm</hi> upon it, <hi>like the blood of a dead man,</hi> more ſafe than theſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <note place="margin">Rev. 16. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>But the things I ſhall preſent as Chriſtian foundations of univerſal Peace and Benignity, and moſt eſpecially among the Diſciples of Chriſtianity, are ſuch as are plainly found in the Word of God, and atteſted by ſound reaſon.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. There may be ſtrong prejudice againſt ſome Principles of Natural Religion, and yet no more argument againſt the truth of them, than that in former times there was a general confident disbelief of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> was a diſproof of them, in which caſes yet Truth will by degrees prevail to victory.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is certain the true and lively characters of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are ſo defac'd and blotted by the fall, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfectly recovered but by Revelation.</p>
                     <p>Many Truths clear enough in themſelves concerning God, his Worſhip, the intercourſe of the ſouls of men with him, and in relation to their eternal condition, yea and in plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Notwithſtanding all theſe former premiſals that ſeem to abate from it, I affirm Natural Religion is a Baſis for the common peace and quietneſs of Mankind, upon which they might eaſily ſo concenter as to preſerve the world from blood and cruelty on religious accounts, if they would (as I have ſaid) <hi>ſhew themſelves men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come therefore to take briefly the intended view of Natural Religion, and to obſerve the intimate union of Chriſtian Religion with it.</p>
                     <p n="1">
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:65165:11"/> I. And firſt the acknowledgment of a ſupreme Being, the <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Giver</hi> of <hi>all,</hi> with all the <hi>Reverence, Love, Obedience, Service</hi> due to him as the great <hi>Author, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, Lord and Judg</hi> of the whole world, is the firſt moſt fundamental Principle of Natural Religion; and ſo plain and evident, that whoever denies it, may without any brand of cruelty be dealt with as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. For firſt he hath unhindg'd the order, ſubordination, and dependance of things, and laid the foundation of a perfect anarchy and confuſion He hath out aſſunder the ſinews of Government, and laid all open to ſpoil and waſte.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He hath undermined all gratitude, and diſſolved the Laws of it, ſeeing receipt of being and preſervation is the foundation of all gratitude; and he that denies this, unties the obligation of Parental Love and affection in children, of duty and ſubjection in inferiors, and ſo offers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of ſuperiors care and protection.</p>
                     <p>And there is no ſubterfuge allowable in this caſe; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man knowing he is neither the Author of his own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor the things that ſupport it; muſt therefore know he is indebted for his being and preſervation ſomewhere; and where can he ſo return it with reaſon, as to that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Jehovah,</hi> whom reaſon it ſelf alwaies preſents, and univerſal nature and conſent of mankind acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hereby all the moſt ſubſtantial reaſons of doing well and avoiding evils, are turn'd into vanity; for inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of, conformity to, awe of a ſupreme righteouſneſs; guilt upon tranſgreſſions, fear of a ſupreme Judgment, are cut off at one blow; and the beſt that can be ſaid for Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is but conveniency; and when that alters, a man may do any thing; every one therefore may juſtly demand ſecurity of him that denies a God, as of a ſuſpicious perſon, of whom he is alwaies as in danger.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:65165:11"/> 4. Such a one can have no conſcience to ſuffer for, he hath no eternal condition to take care for, no higher Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to pleaſe, than on earth; and ſo may well be forced by any ſeverities to pay obedience in Religion to the Powers over him, which only he acknowledges.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Nor can he complain of injuſtice, who hath remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all meaſures of it out of the world, and conſigned all over to fate or chance.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. He that will make himſelf <hi>Heterodox</hi> to all mankind, and differs from the univerſality of humane nature, may well be turned out of that Community as a Monſter.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. That God can be but one, to him that acknowledges a God, is <hi>Mathematick demonſtration;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Infinite</hi> can be <hi>but one;</hi> and to whom the whole love, ſervice, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all creatures is due, He can be but <hi>one;</hi> for if there were more, they muſt be Gods without love and ſervice: he therefore that brings in more Gods than one, is a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to the one true God, ſeeing more eaſily may the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſupport two Suns, one Kingdom two ſupreme Princes; than the nature of things more than one God; <hi>Polytheiſm,</hi> or the owning more Gods than the one true God, is an iniquity juſtly to be puniſhed by the Judg, being the firſt and prime Idolatry.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There being an acknowledgment of a divine Being, there muſt be immediately neceſſary a worſhip and ſervice of him; ſince there cannot be ſuch a Beeing, ſo relating himſelf to mankind, but there is an immediate obligation ariſing hereunto: and to own God yet without ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to mankind (as I united with the mention of God) in the firſt particular, is but another ſort of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> full of all the miſchiefs of that, which ſeems more perfect <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm;</hi> and ſo is not another, but to all the intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of it the ſame, and therefore deſerves the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</p>
                     <p>And if there be a worſhip, it muſt be publick and not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65165:12"/> only, ſeeing the Glory of God is the univerſal intereſt and concernment of mankind, and therefore his honour in the worſhip of him is moſt juſtly under the inſpection of Magiſtrates with whom common intereſts are intruſted.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, there lies an obligation upon Communities as Communities, as well as upon ſingle perſons in their private capacity to worſhip God; and indeed the greater the Community, the more ſolemn the ſervice, the greater glory riſes up to the Divine Majeſty; and the zeal of mens Devotion mutually more excited and inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: This therefore is moſt deſervedly under the publick eye of Authority.</p>
                     <p>But this being agreed, it ſtill remains what this ſervice, this worſhip is? And this is evident, there can be no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God acceptable to him, but what is agreeable to his Divine and Excellent Nature, ſo far as created Nature can comprehend it, can reach up to it.</p>
                     <p>For as the ſervices of Princes are adjuſted to their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Awe and Grandeur; Antiques, Phantaſtique Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, and Mimick motions, become not the dignity of a grave and ſage Court, nor ſordid things its ſplendor.</p>
                     <p>God therefore being Infinite Spirit, Underſtanding, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Goodneſs, his ſervice muſt comport therewith to rationality, ſpirituality, and Conformity with his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt moſt excellent and abſolutely neceſſary ſervice and worſhip of God, is the preſenting him a holy, pure, and intelligent Spirit, in a moſt lowly adoration of, and aſtoniſhment at his incomprehenſible Perfections; in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, fear, and moſt intent love of him, in a ready obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientialneſs to all his commands and counſels, in a ſtedfaſt truſt and reliance upon his Divine aſſiſtances, infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Bounty, and expectation of his gracious Recompences, in humbleſt aſpirings to his likeneſs, and the fruition of him for ever: and all this with a continual eye at his Glory, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65165:12"/> not to any lower end, but in ſubordination to this higheſt; for ſeeing there is ſuch an infinitely glorious Being as God, this is an undoubted Law of Rational Religion, In every thing to aim at his Glory; and this is one eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the Graces of Holy men in Scripture, and the Morality of the virtuous Heathen, that God was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the eye of the one, but the natural Beauty of virtue at the higheſt; and their own Honour moſtly, if not altogether in the view of the other; which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a high offence, and under the Condemnation of Natures Law, if duly applied to it, and examined by it.</p>
                     <p>Next to this fundamental and moſt real worſhip of God, is that external worſhip, which from the ſame Reaſons of Gods being infinite Underſtanding, Spirit and Truth, muſt be alſo moſt Intellectual, and ſpiritual in the Soul, guiding thoſe Organs of the Body moſt prepared to rational uſe, but with the moſt plain, ſimple and unaffected attendance and compliance of geſtures, according to the cuſtom of Countries, as ſtanding, kneeling, bowing, uncovering the head, and ſuch-like decencies of habit and behaviour; and theſe only as following and waiting upon Rational Service, which is all that Natural Religion requires of outward Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>This worſhip of God then in the Diſcourſes of Wiſdom, and Holy Reaſon concerning him, ariſing from deep Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Contemplation of him, Diſcourſes of Obedience to him, and Conformity with his Excellent Attributes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of eternal injoyment of him; Declaration of his Works of Creation and Providence; of his final judgments; of that chief of his ſublunary Works, Humane Nature; Obſervation of the Degeneracy of man by ſin, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the poſſible Recovery and Reſtoration of man by Repentance, of the infinite patience of God, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to pardon, as a ſtrong Incentive to Repentance.</p>
                     <p>For that that Doctrine is made known to men by the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65165:13"/> light of nature, conſequentially, and by way of deduction, though not originally ingrafted, I make no doubt, and that theſe two ways:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. By that obligation to forgive, planted in humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the inclinableneſs of generous minds to it, as an Excellency and Glory of Humane Nature; and therefore it is moſt attributable to God, ſeeing all perfection derives from God, and is moſt attributable to him: <hi>To the Lord</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>our God belong mercies and forgiveneſſes:</hi> He hath declared to man it does ſo, by inſerting it as a Nobleneſs in his heart. They therefore that do not eſteem it a virtue, and of moſt deſirable practiſe in themſelves, may upon that very reaſon diſpair of it from God, ſeeing they count it wiſer and better not to forgive; and whatever is beſt and wiſeſt, is moſt attributable to God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. By the patience of God towards ſinners, which in its moſt natural Inferences leads <hi>to repentance,</hi> and <hi>is ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4, 5. 2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> Infinite goodneſs not being willing that <hi>any ſhould periſh, but all come to repentance;</hi> and therefore that peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential frame diſcoverable in humane nature, upon ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſenſe of ſin, anſwers <hi>this patience of God;</hi> as the Eye and light, as the Ear and ſound do one another, and both together are a connate Goſpel in mans ſoul.</p>
                     <p>If any ſhould think this a derogation from the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he will be ſatisfied, I intend no ſuch, when I tell him, I eſteem; all thoſe notions of Natural Religion and Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as continued to be planted in man, are from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the Creator-Redeemer, by whom every thing was made that is made, who is that true light, that is the light of men; the true light that lighteth every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</hi> Natural Religion therefore may well be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid <note place="margin">John 1. 4, 9.</note> with Evangelical Lines, ſince it is all from Chriſt. The Apoſtles therefore, both St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> diſcourſe it as the great ſin of men againſt natural Knowledg and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>not to know that the goodneſs of God leadeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65165:13"/> 
                        <hi>to deſpiſe the riches of his long-ſuffering, and forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to account it ſlackneſs, and not ſalvation,</hi> which could not be without the grace of God in a pardon made known by natural light; nay indeed all impreſſions of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion continuing and moving to good actions after ſin, are built upon Gods pardoning Mercy, becauſe God allows, receives no worſhip from Devils, who <hi>find no place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; David</hi> therefore celebrates God thus, <hi>There is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs</hi>

                     <p>Thus evident is the Doctrine of Pardon and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that if there be any ſuch thing as Natural Religion ſince the fall, that muſt be a noble branch of it. <hi>The King of Nineveh</hi> had a <hi>confidence</hi> in this Mercy, that ſo peremptory decree of deſtruction notwithſtanding, for the allowance <note place="margin">Jonah 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> of them a quarentine or forty days patience carried a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſe of Pardon upon Repentance in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, elſe why was not the deſtruction immediate? ſo he underſtood, and ſo it proved, and therefore it is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy part of religious publick diſcourſe in the worſhip of God.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond duty of Natural Religion is prayer to God, which our dependance upon God, our expectation from him, both for the holy and happy ſtate of our minds in vertue and godlineſs challenges from us, the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſtate beyond death into the hand of God <hi>as a faithful Creator</hi> requires it of us, the peaceable and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous order and government of the world, and of our nearer concerns in it, National, Domeſtick, Perſonal, provoke us to it; Prayer for pardon and reconciliation to God, Vows of obedience to him, of returns to him by repentance, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary are they? for upon ſuppoſition of ſin and hopes of pardon, the ſame conſiderations enter into prayer that do into diſcourſes of God.</p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:65165:14"/>
                     <p> Now this is a duty ſo natural, that not to pray is <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Praiſes of God in the divine excellencies of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Beeing, in the glories of Creation and Providence, in his Mercies and continual Beneficencies to our ſelves and all his creatures, in his righteouſneſs, judgments and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities upon the wickedneſs that is in the world, are a tribute to God ſo natural, that God <hi>as our Maker</hi> gives <hi>all men ſongs in the night,</hi> that is continual matter of praiſe even in the ordinary and extraordinary ſeaſons: the whole Creation is one Mouth opened in his glory. This is ſo due and even neceſſary to be paid, that ſome Naturaliſts of no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for Devotion, have upon the ſurvey of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable works of God found his praiſes even bubbling up from them in Hymns of Praiſe.</p>
                     <p n="4">4.

                        </gap>grees, (as Heathens did by the force of Natural Religion) can deny or keep back any part of theſe from God? or if any denies them, or does contrary to them by impious ſwearing, blaſpheming the Name of God, or undervalues the awful and tremendous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, or what evidently and undoubtedly pertains to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65165:14"/> Divine Honour and Glory; who can ſay ſeverity upon him is cruelty, but a due ſacrifice to juſtice, as puniſhments for blood, rapine, unnatural luſts are?</p>
                     <p>All theſe then are ſo plain and evident Duties, that they need nothing of further diſcourſe, but only a ſober reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their own evidence in order to their prevalency in the underſtanding of men.</p>
                     <p>And for the manner of performance, beſides the very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity required in ſuch awful actions, the prudence of ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal nature in its ſolemn deportments, the greateſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency required to divine things that can ariſe from nature and not from artifice, I know nothing to be added except a caution to reſt here, and not to ſuffer the tranſports and inchantments of a fleſhly imagination that is endleſly ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out it ſelf in forms and modes of divine worſhip, till that worſhip become not a piece of pageantry only, for that were harmleſs in compariſon; but the abomination of idolatry and ſuperſtition, moſt loathſome to that infinitely pure and ſpiritual Nature.</p>
                     <p>I come in the next place to conſider how far time, place, diſtinction of perſons in religious worſhip, are within the cogniſance of the law and light of Nature. For I omit out of choice any diſcourſe of ſacrifices, which ſome have contended came in by natural inſtinct, as too copious for the preſent intendment, concluding they were ordained by God chiefly to typifie the true, ever breathing ſacrifice of Chriſt, which ſervice having performed, they expired in it, not only repealed by the Evangelick Law, but (no doubt) through the ſuperintendency of Providence grown into diſuſe throughout the world, which together with thoſe ſtrong ſolid Reaſons againſt their valuableneſs in themſelves given by God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10, &amp;c. ſufficiently argue they were not of natural notion, nor of the everlaſting Righteouſneſs of that Law.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore, waving them, go on to debate the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65165:15"/> of Primitive rules concerning time; and I find but two things I can ſuppoſe injunctions of ſo ancient a date pertaining to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the time be ſufficient, capacious enough for the receipt of Religious duty and action, ſufficient for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ample inquiries and ſearches into Divine things; for the ſouls commoration, and reſt upon them for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of Religious buſineſs and duty; and ſo ſuitable and agreeable to the teſtification of our honour to the ſupreme Majeſty, by offering ſuch a proportion of our time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſuch frequency of returns, with the <hi>favour of ſeaſon,</hi> and <hi>redeeming ſeaſon,</hi> when it ſeems to fly from us; that in all we may have a liberal ſpace for ſo grand a buſineſs in our more ſtated and occaſional performances.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That in what concerns publick worſhip, the time be commenſurate, as in the former particular, to all the ends and purpoſes of publick worſhip, the occaſions and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of it, and particularly that it be known, agreed, and indicted for that ſervice.</p>
                     <p>But for the <hi>ſeventh part of time,</hi> though undoubtedly pitcht upon with infinite wiſdom, juſtice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> conveyed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted tradition of that command, having no more natural in it, than the general compromiſe of the world in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Time into Sevens, or weeks, ſeldomer than which no reaſonable ſenſe of Religion could allow for the recurrency of ſolemn publick worſhip, mix'd with continued private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, as in <hi>extraordinary</hi> to <hi>every days</hi> ſervice. Elſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceive it could be defin'd by the laws of natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. For <hi>place,</hi> theſe two things are alſo neceſſary.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>places</hi> be as agreeable as may be to the end; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and retired places for retired and ſecret worſhip; places
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65165:15"/> of domeſtick coveniency for Families; and publick, known, and agreed, for publick worſhip.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That places for Divine Worſhip have the decency, gravity and ſolemnity that is ſuitable to ſuch a degree and quality of buſineſs as is there to be negotiated; not as any part of Divine Worſhip, or ſo much as having any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential conduciveneſs upon the mind in ſuch action, but ſolely as the reſult of humane prudence adjuſting every thing to its proper uſe and ſervice, and with the <hi>decorum</hi> moſt natural to it.</p>
                     <p>For time and place having no influence upon Religious actions, more than upon all common humane actions by any peculiar vertue of their own, they cannot without a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Sanctification from God, with which he by his revealed will acquaints thoſe upon whom he is pleaſed to enjoin the obſervation, riſe any higher than themſelves. Nor can hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane appointment extend them beyond expediency and decency; the ordinary rules by which all things civil and humane are ſquar'd.</p>
                     <p>Devotion can mount nothing higher than its own true elevation as to the nature of the thing. Devotion (I ſay) and zeal aſcend up to God, yet they leave the things they uſe behind to reſt in their own ſtation. It being a Divine power that makes any thing Divine or Sacred, or efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any ſuch productions. Without this, every thing reſts upon its own baſis of natural aptitude, obſerved and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by reaſon to thoſe ends and purpoſes whereunto that aptitude ſerves.</p>
                     <p>Time and place rated beyond themſelves, become injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to religious ſervices, receiving more of the minds at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and reſpect than is due to them; which being wholly oblig'd to a total, ſole, and ſingle determination upon the Divine Majeſty it ſelf, muſt not look off from it, but under the peril of moving that jealouſie God expreſſes in the Scriptures; and if not thus, yet they beget in men
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65165:16"/> injurious thoughts of God, as if <hi>he dwelt in Temples made with hands,</hi> and the preſence of the <hi>Lord of Heaven and Earth</hi> confin'd there; whereas except by his own choice upon certain reaſons, as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> all places are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and He equally accepts thoſe that worſhip him <hi>in ſpirit and truth.</hi> He that inhabits Ubiquity, is no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, <note place="margin">Joh. 4. 21, 23, 24.</note> or diſdains mean and unadorn'd places for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, than ſtately Structures. To miſdeem ſo of God, hath a degree of that folly that would reſtrain his Omnipreſence leſt it ſhould be defil'd with the ſordidneſs of ſome recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nauſeous to us; not knowing that Infinite Spirit feels not the paſſions of body: our Saviour made uſe of any place for Heavenly Diſcourſes and Prayers: to obſerve days or times, carries a ſuſpition, that he who inhabits eternity, and is Lord of time, is not all times the ſame; and therefore the Heathen that had corrupted natural Religion, watcht for ſome days as more lucky, and avoided others as unluckly in their attendances on their mock-deities. Yet doth God allow to men the wiſe and prudent choice of their own conveniences in his worſhip, both for time or place, not preſuming to ſanctifie any thing to him, that he hath not firſt ſanctified to himſelf; for who knows how to chuſe for him? or <hi>who is able to give to him firſt?</hi> This muſt needs be the determination of natural reaſon, if it uſe its own light, and diſcharge its own truſt.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpoken thus briefly of <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> I come to the third thing, <hi>Diſtinction or ſeparation of perſons for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine offices;</hi> how far it is directed by natural Religion, under theſe three Heads.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In the firſt Ages of the world, <hi>Patriarchal Elderſhip,</hi> nearneſs to the Creation, and continual acquaintance with the Hiſtory of Gods Treaties and dealings with men, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Power, Gravity, Authority reſident in it, carried the moſt fit adminiſtration of Divine Things along with it, ſo that the <hi>Pontifical, Prophetick,</hi> and <hi>Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65165:16"/> accumulated upon them: this ſeems unqueſtionable in Reaſon, Scripture, Hiſtory, and univerſal tradition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. After the multiplication of Families into Nations, and greater Communities, and that <hi>Patriarchate</hi> and <hi>Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture</hi> loſt it ſelf in the numerouſneſs of Mankind; Reaſon advis'd to the orderly ſeparating, and dedicating ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to the continual attendance upon Sacred Offices.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That they might be the more Authoritative herein, as perſons of greateſt ſanctity, wiſdom, attainments in knowledg, were moſt recommended to ſuch a choice; ſo Education, ſeparation to Reading, Meditation, Study, for attainment of knowledg, muſt be the means under the eye of Natural Religion, for enabling perſons for the diſcharge of ſuch Functions.</p>
                     <p>For there are but three ways whereby perſons can be ſuppoſed authorized to preſidency in Divine Things.</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. By <hi>Parental</hi> Authority, the ſame with <hi>Patriarchal.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. By <hi>Eminency of Parts and Gifts</hi> join'd with dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves, and orderly approbation to publick office.</item>

                     <p>The firſt two are of Natural Sanction, the laſt of Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Ordination.</p>
                     <p>And ſo far as appears by Sacred Records, no one of them excludes from Diſcourſes and Inſtructions of even a publick character, thoſe that have eminent gifts and inablements, though not by immediate inſpiration; as <hi>Elihu</hi> having an excellent ſpirit, equal'd himſelf with men of days, and years, as he himſelf ſpeaks, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 7, 8.</p>

                     <p>And it ſeems to me an error of too much a like enormity againſt innate reaſon, to bring down Divine Offices to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65165:17"/> ſuch prepar'd preſcription, as the moſt uneducated, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted, undedicated perſons to knowledg, ſtudy, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might perform, ſo that they have nothing to truſt to, but (as it is call'd) the <hi>indelible</hi> character of Ordination, which will hardly bear them out in the Court of natural Conſcience, and therefore cannot eaſily attone them to the rules of Revealed Religion, which never contradicts, or ſo much as diſpenſes with natural.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, to clog the higher dignified perſons in this Miniſtry with ſo much of rule and buſineſs, as hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the performance of theſe Divine Offices with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt effects of that ſtudy and meditation before ſpoken of, runs into the ſame ill conſequence, and exchanges a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice into a ſecular Grandeur. Elſe no one hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to envy, that they who are Princes in Righteouſneſs, Truth, and Peace, and <hi>Prieſts indeed of the moſt High God,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And ſo I have run through thoſe things that more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concern <hi>the firſt and greateſt commandment,</hi> but <hi>like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                        <hi>theſe</hi> are Righteouſneſs, Juſtice, Mercy, Truth, Sobriety, Temperance, Charity, Humility, Modeſty, Patience, general love, peaceableneſs, containing our ſelves within our own bounds, order, ſubmiſſion to Government, with perfect ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all things that do not contradict obedience to God, together with all thoſe things that ſpeak virtue, goodneſs, lovelineſs, good report, honour, eſteem in human con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 8.</note> which ſo far as they can come under the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of man, and can be regulated by laws, ſo far as they can come into palpable inſtances, are worthy of rewards, and encouragements, and the contrary of puniſhments. This is natural Religion, and it ſtands upon this unmovable foundation; Nothing is more truly Religion, or rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Divine Majeſty, than thoſe things which do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65165:17"/> moſt perfect humane nature into a conformity with God.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the firſt and chiefeſt in the order or ſcale of Religious excellencies, are the things that are moſt really good: the more ſubſtantial, rational, ſolidly good any thing is, the more it <hi>pleaſes God,</hi> and <hi>muſt be approved of</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus all the maſſy acts of Love to God and men, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Righteouſneſs, Soberneſs, excel all the Honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be done to God by prayer, praiſes, diſcourſes of him, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Next diſcourſes of his word and will in order to learn o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, are of higher account than prayer, for <hi>He that</hi>

                     <p>There may be now a <hi>ſolemn appeal</hi> made to all the world, whether Chriſtian Religion is defective in one ſingle point of this true Natural Religion at the higheſt and fulleſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of it poſſible to be conceived: here is the <hi>height</hi> and <hi>depth,</hi> the <hi>breadth</hi> and <hi>length</hi> of Natural Knowledg, concerning God, concerning good and evil, concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, according to the moſt ſober ſedate judgment of Mankind, the univerſal conſent of the world, the moſt ready <hi>accuſations</hi> and <hi>defences</hi> all men make in points of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> in their treaties and debates one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, according to the diſcourſes of the moſt Wiſe, Learned, and Virtuous of the Philoſophers, the beſt of Lawgivers. If then there be the moſt Wiſe, the moſt Good, the moſt Virtuous that ever was in nature found in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, abating nothing but <hi>poſitive Laws, topical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Rites and Cuſtoms;</hi> what a foundation of peace, quietneſs and happy ſtate might a conſent but in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion (as it is fairly extant in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion)
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65165:18"/> be! and what a conviction of the Chriſtian verity would ſuch an acceptance of Natural Undeniable Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it be! when juſt as in the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> thoſe <note place="margin">Acts 2. 8.</note> ſeveral ſorts of people heard the wonderful Works of God, each in their own language; ſo in Chriſtianity, every one finds what ever they can think (excepting their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Rites) moſt generally, truly, and valuably good, and that upon deepeſt conſiderations, ſtricteſt examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and even uncontroverſable certainty.</p>
                     <p>And how benign and compaſſionate might mankind be to it ſelf, if ſummoning together theſe truly excellent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and framing its <hi>Religious Laws</hi> according to them, they exacted a ſevere conformity in all, that is thus <hi>vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and allowed a benign freedom of offering and receiving the beſt accounts that can be given of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther revelations from God, forbearing injury, violence, and blood; and then alſo it would ſoon appear what an <hi>indiſputable title,</hi> that only excellent <hi>Religion</hi> of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> hath to be the <hi>truly Catholick Religion</hi> of the whole world; and ſo far to ſet it at peace.</p>
                     <p>Now though there is little reaſon to expect this will come to paſs, till <hi>a ſpirit be poured out from on high,</hi> and theſe <hi>rivers of truth break out in the wilderneſs,</hi> till the great <hi>Prophecies</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> looking to a better ſtate of the world come to be fulfilled: Yet ſtill according to the rule of right Reaſon, it ſhould be ſo; nor doth it diminiſh the reaſonableneſs, or ſilence the offers of the Reaſons, that they are not likely to have their effect, there being many other (in the event) incurable evils upon men, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of right Reaſon, the cure of which yet any one may freely offer and diſcouſe.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt I thus argue: If a man have no <hi>notes of diſtinction</hi> within, if there be not a Religious, Rational Underſtanding planted by God as a nature in man; if there be not Principles ingrafted into that Underſtanding, how ſhall a man know the goodneſs of anything propos'd to him, the conformity of it with what it is pretended to be?</p>
                     <p>When our Saviour challenged the Phraiſees requiring a ſign from Heaven for the truth of his Doctrine thus: <hi>Why even of</hi> (or from within) <hi>your ſelves judg ye not what is</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 5, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>right?</hi> He imply'd, The very eſſence of a man as an Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Rational Spirit, muſt be alſo full of <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Moral Principles,</hi> and ſo muſt have innate judgment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Truth, as many other Scriptures aſſure us. Without this a man can have nothing but an <hi>Implicite faith</hi> for his Religion, a ſtrong belief, it's true. Now ſeeing <hi>Turks, Jews, Papiſts,</hi> every one that is throughly poſſeſs'd with his Religion hath the ſame; this kind of Faith is no other than theſe <hi>ſeveral Religioniſts</hi> laying a wager one with another, which is the true Religion; and it greatly derogates from the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> to ſuppoſe there is no more but this <hi>confident adventure</hi> for it, rather than for any other, and no grand aſſurance within in <hi>Natural Religion.</hi> Even mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65165:19"/> of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> however immediately from God, muſt be hence known and diſcovered, elſe every thing that calls it ſelf Revelation muſt be taken for Divine.</p>
                     <p>Although the <hi>Prophets</hi> might be at ſome times under a ſtrong ſupernatural hand, that <hi>tranſported their minds,</hi> as it did alſo in <hi>extraordinary caſes their bodies;</hi> yet they were generally under the <hi>ſtill-voice,</hi> ſpeaking to their faculties, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning their reaſon, ſanctifying their affections, by which they had even at the time of their <hi>greateſt raptures</hi> a ſenſe of the excellency of Divine Truth, an habitual acquaintance with the ways of Divine approach and preſence; a <hi>ſearch into the things</hi> they had ſpoken, even after they had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>They ſearched what or what manner of time the Spirit that was in them, did ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 11.</note> They had a <hi>holy guſt</hi> of <hi>Divine things,</hi> a judgment diſcerning between any ſort of <hi>private ſpirit,</hi> and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit of Grace and Truth: elſe how did they differ from <hi>Balaam?</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. ult.</note>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Abraham</hi> no doubt had a free debate with himſelf of the certainty that the <hi>voice</hi> was Divine that <hi>commanded him to</hi>

But Infinite Truth and Goodneſs always jealous over the ſacredneſs of Nature's Laws, would not permit the execution.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>power of Miracles</hi> is not their <hi>aſtoniſhment of ſenſe,</hi> but ſummoning mens minds with great authority to Rational and Religious Conſiderations, laid up in ſtore within them.</p>
                     <p>The ſum then of this Point is this: Natural Religion always with us, as intimate as our faculties, as certain and true as <hi>they</hi> are, in their <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>creation,</hi> muſt be our <hi>Ordeal,</hi> if I may ſo call it, our <hi>Fiery,</hi> our ſureſt way of trial, of all Propoſals made to us in Religion; that is after
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65165:19"/> due awakening our minds, and examination of things by them; and the <hi>bleſſed aſſiſtances, or higheſt infuſions of the Divine Spirit</hi> are breath'd into our natural ſentiments in things pertaining to God, inlightned, purified, and guided into all truth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond Branch follows, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſtian Religion hath ſuch an evident agreement with Natural Religion, as to be approved, and recommended by it, even in what it reveals above, and beyond Natural Religion. Now if it be firſt evident, there is not <hi>one good thing</hi> in that whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>(as every thing in it is holy, juſt, and good)</hi> but Chriſtianity hath united it ſelf with it ſelf, it hath ſo carefully gathered <hi>up all the fragments of it,</hi> that <hi>no one thing</hi> is or can be <hi>loſt.</hi> And if it be made good in the ſecond place, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſtian Religion reveals beyond natural Religion, endures the <hi>touch</hi> of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> and is (beſides its own <hi>proper credentials)</hi> recommended by it, there cannot be any thing added to evince that Chriſtian Religion is a foundation of <hi>Oecumenical peace in Religion,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Natural Religion</hi> is the <hi>Oecumenick Religion,</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> of all <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</hi> It muſt be ſo, for every man hath <hi>it written in his heart,</hi> and Chriſtian Religion is in much of it, <hi>one and the ſame Religion,</hi> is all of it moſt agreeable with <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and recommended by it. It then neceſſarily follows, no man can be wiſely, <hi>Rationally Religious,</hi> but he muſt be ſo far <hi>Chriſtianly Religious;</hi> and what Chriſtian Religion offers beyond the wiſdom and rationality of a man, beyond <hi>the Law of the firſt creation,</hi> is yet as agreeable with it, <hi>as light with light, greater light</hi> with <hi>leſſer light,</hi> how then can he that ſhews himſelf man, be cruel, outragious againſt, or out of peace with it? He that falls out with it, falls out with <hi>Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs, Soberneſs, Humility, Truth, peace with God, attonement to him, with laying hold upon Eternal Life, and flying from the wrath to come, with Patience, Meekneſs, Mercy, Compaſſion from God to men, from men to one another.</hi>

                     <p>I cannot ſee what Religion or Devotion (except that which ignorance is the mother of, and which cannot be good, no more than the heart that uſes it) can ſuffer by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſie of acceſs, familiar, unencumbred; the moſt plain, free, intelligible inſtitution of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> was at length corrupted into <hi>the idolatrous Maſs,</hi> by being made horrid, as the <gap reason="foreign">

Religion by being ſolid and ſubſtantial is beſt ſecur'd from the ſtroak of the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> who accuſes it of trick and deſign; for when there are found Ceremonial covers, like <hi>pious frauds</hi> over it, and they eaſily yield to Attack as of no value, the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently challenges all the reſt by proportion, and renders it ſuſpicious.</p>
                     <p>It is beſt ſecur'd againſt the <hi>ſchiſmatick</hi> and unquiet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is truly ſo, for he hath ſomething in unneceſſary Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony to faſten on, and move trouble by. It is kindeſt to the more modeſt ſcrupulous perſon, who is upon great Reaſons afraid of humane additions to divine worſhip.</p>
                     <p>Ceremony can add nothing to the truly wiſe and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Religious perſon, who loves Religion for it ſelf, and needs not the childiſh and Phantaſtick Gaudery or Gayety of Ceremonies to inamor him of Religion; he loves it for its true worth, for its native Beauty, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial excellency.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore only fitted to the <hi>Hypochondriack Devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> who loves Religion in ſuch a kind of ſet ſolemn dreſs, or to the <hi>empty Formaliſt</hi> that muſt have it ſo adorned, or recommended; or to <hi>vulgar, unlearned,</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi> minds, who muſt be catch'd with ſhows and pompous appearances, and kept in amuſe, that they may be ſomewhat intent in Religious excerciſe; but with this diſadvantage, that they ſeldom pierce further than this ſurface, or take notice of

                     <p>But now ſubſtantial, maſſive Religion yields not to ſuch ſort of Attacks, but like Rock reſiſts, ſupported with its own ſubſtance, born upon its own truth.</p>
                     <p>And therefore were it not for the excellency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, of Divine Revelation in the Scriptures, I ſhould rather chooſe (as he ſaid) to have my ſoul among the Wiſe, Rationally Religious <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> (if ſuch can be found) then with any Religion that this day appears in the world, not excepting the <hi>Romiſh</hi> that hath deturpated, and diſhonoured the only excellent Religion; and as it is <hi>Romiſh</hi> is the worſe, becauſe it is <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>

                     <p>And whereas it is pretended, Religious Action looks bare and naked, and unadorned, when not ſhaded, and graced, and covered with Rituals.</p>
                     <p>They are only weak and feminine minds that think ſo.

                     <p>And therefore indeed much of this ſort hath proceeded

For there being then no converſion of Princes, nor ſo general converſion of private perſons as ſhould be <hi>expreſſed by all men,</hi> there could be no matter for <hi>Thanksgiving.</hi> But that which was mainly in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> eye, was, that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould concern themſelves in all the <hi>happineſs</hi> and <hi>welfare of mankind,</hi> both by <hi>Supplications, Prayers, and Interceſſions;</hi> that is, with all the earneſtneſs, and heartineſs ſignified in that accumulation of expreſſions, and alſo by <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> for the mercies they enjoyed; and in <hi>eminent manner</hi> for Kings and thoſe in <hi>eminency,</hi> who are the <hi>Truſtees</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitaries</hi> of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> of the world; and by this means <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> ſhould be known to be moſt agreeable with the true <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>excellent Religion</hi> of <hi>mankind,</hi> and a fair <hi>Rational Inducement</hi> offered to embrace it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The advantage the Apoſtle expreſſes as ariſing from the due performance of this duty; That men in general
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65165:28"/> and Princes in ſpecial, being convinced of their rights by the evidence of thoſe two main parts of <hi>Natural Religion, Piety towards God, Love of Humane nature,</hi> and the <hi>

A great argument of the <hi>Truth</hi> of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that hath drawn up all Rational Religion, Reaſon, and Learning within it ſelf, and under its own Horizon.</p>
                     <p>For though for a time it pleaſed God to allow the notable efforts of that ſort of learning, and in oppoſition to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, one of his unſearchable Judgments, as in <hi>Porphyry</hi> and <hi>Hierocles;</hi> yet being vanquiſhed by the greater light of the Goſpel, ſince the days of <hi>Constantine,</hi> it hath never riſen in any other parts of the <hi>world unchriſtianiz'd,</hi> to appear with any remarkable ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>But all this doth not diminiſh ſo much from <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as it brings it into queſtion, Whether there is now ſuch a thing in the world as <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> without Chriſtianity? nay indeed, it may be doubted whether not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,

                     <p>And it is taken out of thoſe places of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> firſt what he records in his Goſpel, that our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father that</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>By all theſe ſayings laid together, it ſeems undeniable, that even the acknowledgment of that firſt and great prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> The believing in, and adoring <hi>the one God,</hi> is made of no value, by not acknowledging, honouring, and believing in Chriſt the Son, which is the principal point of Divine Revelation.</p>
                     <p>For the ſetling therefore this <hi>doubt,</hi> theſe three Things are to be conſider'd:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That after due Inſtruction and Explanation of the <hi>Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> it is, as I have ſaid, ſo united with <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion,</hi> that who ever hath that in ſincerity, is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, ſet in a poſture ready to receive and believe Chriſtianity. So that if any one upon Inſtruction commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the Underſtanding <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>he hath not God,</hi> he hath not true <hi>Natural Religion</hi> in that <hi>Fundamental point,</hi> eſpecially if he have had the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Divine Revelation in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> as the <hi>Jews,</hi> to whom theſe words were eſpecially directed, had. Yet ſtill, I ſuppoſe this caſe reſerv'd to Divine judgment, and not to Humane; nor that ſuch an unbeliever may be dealt with by men, or by <hi>Magiſtratical Authority,</hi> as an Athieſt; man can only deal with him by <hi>Remonſtrances</hi> out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>reaſons</hi> flowing from it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <p>No <hi>dream, wonder,</hi> or <hi>praediction</hi> however <hi>fulfilled,</hi> was <hi>Authentick</hi> enough to draw the <hi>Jews</hi> from the true God, that <note place="margin">Deut. 13. 1.</note> had ſo <hi>ſupremely demonſtrated</hi> himſelf to them; nor might <hi>any Angel</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is, <hi>Immediate Inſpiration,</hi> or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine given by it, ſeduce them from Chriſt, ſo evidently ſeal'd to them in the <hi>New, by God the Father;</hi> and therefore <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 27.</note> all pretenſions to the contrary, how high ſoever, are to be rejected with deteſtation.</p>
                     <p>They knew, All that endeavoured it, muſt know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>deceivers,</hi> the greateſt <hi>crime</hi> againſt <hi>Natural Religion;</hi> and indeed none ſo ſubject to <hi>Humane Inquiry,</hi> to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, or ſeverity when detected, as <hi>Impoſtors</hi> pretending Divine Revelation.

                     </p>
                     <p>And next to theſe, an Apoſtate from Chriſtianity can hardly, if at all, give ſuch an account of himſelf to <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Powers,</hi> as ſhould clear him from being a moſt <hi>hainous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender</hi> againſt <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>

                     <p>We may with greater certainty ſolicite men upon theſe Principles, than evil men tempt one another upon common depravation: For corruption, though all one in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, yet lyes in more ſeveral veins than theſe laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conſcience; ſo that men may be miſs'd by thoſe that tempt them out of their proper inclinations to evils, as hitt in the wrong vein.</p>
                     <p>But there are none of theſe lines of natural Conſcience wanting in any man, nor an aptneſs to be mov'd in them; if ſearcht to the quick, they will feel it to conviction, though too often not to converſion.</p>

                     <p>He did not firſt preach Chriſt to them, a point without them; but getting within them in natural Principles, he aſſayed by the continuity and ſimilarneſs of the one with the other, to intwine (as with admirable artifice he does) thoſe Natural Principles with Chriſtianity.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Objections that I can foreſee againſt this Argument, lye theſe two ways.</p>

                        <hi>If the</hi> Laws of Nature <hi>are ſo clear and evident, how comes it to paſs there is ſo great a darkneſs and ignorance in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of perſons, yea in Nations, concerning</hi> theſe Laws? <hi>And yet how much leſs is the Obedience paid to them? And laſtly, how comes it to paſs there never was ſuch a</hi> Concord and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement <hi>in them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to this I ſhould only briefly rejoin theſe two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That notwithſtanding this, there always hath been, and will be ſuch <hi>Evidences</hi> of the <hi>Truth, Righteouſneſs, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs,</hi> and <hi>Naturalneſs</hi> of theſe Religious Principles, that no more can they be baniſhed out of <hi>Humane nature,</hi> than the <hi>Notions of Health, Beauty, Happineſs</hi> can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in the world, notwithſtanding all the diſeaſe, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation from the exact model of <hi>Beauty,</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhappineſs, Miſery</hi> and <hi>Complaint</hi> ſo <hi>univerſal</hi> in the <hi>world;</hi> ſo that though there is not any Example of the perfection of any of theſe in this world, and very great and general <hi>Deficiencies</hi> from them: yet the Notions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65165:37"/> one are whole and intire, and ſuch repreſentations and approaches to what we mean in them are ſo viſible, as to take away all doubt of the things themſelves, and of the deſirableneſs of them; even ſo it is in this <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The whole diſadvantage then of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, muſt be imputed to the miſerable <hi>depravation of mankind,</hi> to that degree, that the moſt excellent things ſo loſe their effect, as even to ſeem to loſe themſelves; yet ſtill they remain, and ſo remain, as to require and even exact their acknowledgment, and ſo demand that due ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and that ſo powerfully, that the <hi>juſtice of the demand preſſed home,</hi> cannot be <hi>denied;</hi> and thus it is in <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Object. <hi>It may be objected f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r the enforcement of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion by ſeverities, That when the Reaſons of it are laid before men (as of the</hi> true Chriſtian Religion) <hi>lying in a</hi> ſtraight <hi>and</hi> even line <hi>from Natural Religion to it, it can only</hi> be the Brutiſhneſs <hi>and</hi> Obſtinacy <hi>of men that they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, which may be juſtly puniſhed as against the</hi> Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>and the</hi> interpretation of Puniſhment <hi>ſhall be, not as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to compel them into the</hi> Chriſtian Religion, <hi>but to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiſe their</hi> Beaſt-like Senſleſneſs <hi>or</hi> Obſtinacy.</p>
                     <p>In Anſwer to this I would re-enforce theſe three things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the main of the Objection, there is ſo great a difference between <hi>Naturals</hi> that will certainly riſe up at earneſt and vehement ſummons, being within already, though they may lye hid and deep; and what is purely from without and muſt enter through thoſe <hi>multiform, Meander'd, twisted</hi> and <hi>twined paſſages</hi> of mens <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings</hi> and <hi>intellectual Belief,</hi> through varieties of Tempers, Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Principles, men have moſt convers'd with, and rivetted their whole ſouls into; that it is impoſſible for any but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65165:37"/> God alone, who ſearches the heart, to know, where the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obſtruction lyes, when the ſcrews of truth, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of mens minds do not reciprocate and anſwer one another; where the key of Truth and the wards of mens thoughts ſo diſſent, as not to be reconciled; ſo that this muſt be left for ever as to <hi>Divine Omnipotency</hi> in the efficacy, ſo to the <hi>Divine Judgment</hi> where the fault is, of mens not <hi>receiving</hi> what is ſo graciouſly <hi>offered from Heaven.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Therefore to pretend to judg obſtinacy, or inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, or whatever other faulty Reaſon we have prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of mens not receiving the Religion we would impoſe, is to aſſume Divine prerogative to our ſelves, and to become Judges in His peculiar Court, or to contrive an <hi>Artifice</hi> to cheat an <hi>acknowledged Principle,</hi> (viz. <hi>not compelling Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion)</hi> of its <hi>due Obedience;</hi> and laſtly, to cloath innocent perſons, for any thing we know, with the <hi>Sambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> painted with Devils or Beaſts skins, wherein they may appear guilty with the diſguiſe we have put upon them, though out of that they cannot with Charity be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nocent, or guilty of thoſe particulars, we charge them with.</p>
                     <p>All this is to be underſtood, when the offence, and the particular offence (it being not enough in this caſe to ſay there is ſome offence without <hi>ſpecial matter charged</hi> againſt Natural Laws) is not as evident, as in any other caſe of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane judicature; and where the only proof that men are otherwiſe guilty in not receiving the Faith we offer them, is only this, that they do not receive it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. If this puniſhing men for not receiving a Revealed Religion, were only for not receiving <hi>ſubſtantial Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion,</hi> it were the more tollerable; though as I have ſaid, not deſirable to any <hi>true Chriſtian Proteſtant;</hi> but when it's ſtretch'd out to <hi>Falſe Religion,</hi> to every <hi>nice Opinion, Ceremony</hi> or <hi>Mode of worſhip,</hi> it is a <hi>burthen</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind could never bear, being moſt <hi>intollerable:</hi> And ſo I have done with <hi>this ſecond Argument.</hi>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65165:38"/>
                     <p> Argum. 3. I proceed to a third Argument, <hi>Juſtifying Natural Religion to be the term of univerſal peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord;</hi> ſo far that if that be ſecur'd, men ſhould acquieſce in peace one with another, in things that concern Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Magiſtrates allowing common protection, and people the common benevolence of Humanity; as upon a ruled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined caſe,</hi> that <hi>Reaſon and Truth</hi> ought to have, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> and the very <hi>Laws of Nature, a Through fare in the world, free as the Air and Light,</hi> and that by an <hi>Ordinance as early as of the day.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I argue this, I premiſe, That all Religious Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms are under the <hi>intire acknowledgment of Princes</hi> within their own <hi>Dominions in all cauſes, and over all perſons, as well Eccleſiaſtical, as Civil</hi> (in the very ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England) ſupreme Moderators, and Governours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As alſo, that it is more deſirable all things of a Religious concern ſhould have the countenance, encouragement, and example of <hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>Symphony of Communities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet ſtill with this <hi>condition,</hi> it is the <hi>Birthright</hi> of every man to be avowedly and publickly Religious, according to thoſe Rules he believers, agreeable to the <hi>Divine Will, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion being Judg.</hi> And that this is according to the very <hi>inſtitution of God himſelf,</hi> and no way inconſiſtent with the Laws of ſubjection to Magiſtracy, or being a <hi>commodious</hi> and <hi>agreeable member of a Community.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For if there be not ſuch a <hi>Natural Freedom,</hi> there is no way left, ſince that general corruption of Religion in the world, for a man ordinarily to reduce himſelf, and induce others <hi>to reform themſelves and their open profeſſion of God, to true and regular thoughts and acknowledgments of God, his worſhip and ſervice,</hi> and the ways of pleaſing him in order to the <hi>eternal enjoyment</hi> of him.</p>
                     <p>For it often falls out in the world, that Magiſtrates and People ſit in their <hi>Idol-Temple of a falſe Religion,</hi> guarded with their Laws for Uniformity, environed with their
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65165:38"/> own Canons and Conſtitutions, and threatning <hi>ſeverest pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties to any diſturber.</hi> Though we have reaſon <hi>to bleſs God our lines are fallen in pleaſant places; yea we have a goodly inheritance</hi> of Religion by our Laws; which very much bribes our judgment of the <hi>Dureſſe</hi> of <hi>Impoſitions in Religion,</hi> becauſe we only conſider it in <hi>ceremonies impos'd,</hi> and do not <hi>turn our ſelves to behold the abominations</hi> in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not only committed but <hi>framed by a Law.</hi> But <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi> is <hi>impoſition</hi> in the leaſt things in Religion, <hi>not natural;</hi> and opens the way to it in the greateſt.</p>
                     <p>If it be not therefore before hand taken care of by ſuch an <hi>Immunity,</hi> reſerv'd to <hi>Humane nature,</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> to Rulers, that moſt funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principle of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> in <hi>Piety</hi> towards <hi>God,</hi> iſſuing it ſelf in <hi>declarations</hi> of his <hi>Name, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Glory; in charity and compaſſion</hi> to the <hi>ſouls of men,</hi> (whoſe caſe, though not themſelves, <hi>cry out, as the man of</hi> Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia <hi>in</hi> Paul<hi>'s viſion, Come and help us)</hi> muſt lye ſtill as a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <note place="margin">Act. 16. 9.</note> hid in a Napkin, and buried in the earth; or muſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and fall foul with another <hi>Law of nature</hi> viz. of <hi>Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> in their Religious Laws.</p>
                     <p>But if their <hi>right to command</hi> only in and according to <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> the beſt, moſt honourable, and ſafe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that God thought fit to depoſite with men, that they ſhould hold the Golden Reigns of <hi>Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs, Soberneſs,</hi> far greater than of <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and ſafer than of Revealed Religion, a <hi>chariot too divine for man to govern:</hi> If this, I ſay, be the caſe, men need not cloiſter Religion in their breaſt for fear of violating ſo awful a <hi>Sanction,</hi> as that of <hi>Magiſtracy.</hi> Nor while they confeſs it (neither afraid, nor aſham'd of the publick diſcountenance), do any thing injurious to Divine Diſpoſition of power to Rulers.</p>
                     <p>If this were not the true, natural, legal ſtate of things in relation to Religion and Magiſtrates, and the very Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God in Creation concerning them, this further
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65165:39"/> 
                        <hi>grand inconvenience</hi> would follow, That the moſt excellent Religion of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo careful of all juſt rights and duty, <hi>Dividing to Caeſar the things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, and reſerving to God the things that are Gods;</hi> yet that <note place="margin">Luk. 20. 25.</note> this Religion came in as it were treading upon <hi>the necks of Princes,</hi> and their Laws, and diſacknowledging that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er entruſted with them by God, the power of firſt Decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, though it were allowed, <hi>He</hi> intended only the <hi>true</hi> Religion.</p>
                     <p>For it is moſt evident, Chriſtian Religion came into the world <hi>againſt the will of all Humane Powers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I know it will be ſaid, Our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their immediate commiſſion from Heaven, of which Miracles were their Credentials, could not in the leaſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Humane Power,</hi> which falls before the Divine, as the loweſt Magiſtrate among us before the Supreme. I confeſs this is moſt true; yet ſtill it is to be conſider'd, what great care God hath of his <hi>Moral, Natural, Fundamental conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions;</hi> and it is not at all to be believed, he would in ſo weighty a concern as <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> have ſo far neglected his <hi>Ordinance of Magistracy,</hi> as not at firſt to have preſented that Doctrine, and the miraculous evidences of it to the <hi>Vicegerents</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> here upon earth; that at leaſt they ſhould have been guilty of a peremptory refuſal, before their <hi>deputation</hi> in the propagation of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> had been waved by God. I cannot therefore account the Supremacy of Divine Power above Humane, the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that God took no more notice (not of Magiſtrates only, but) of Magiſtracy it ſelf, when he <hi>brought in the firſt begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> and his <hi>Religion into the world;</hi> and that he did not ſay, <hi>Let all theſe Angels of God on earth worſhip him,</hi> in the firſt place.</p>
                     <p>We ſee in all things that could but have the appearance of being under their <hi>proper juriſdiction,</hi> how cautious our Saviour was not to offend; as in the caſe of <hi>Tribute,</hi> though
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65165:39"/> he <hi>as a Son over the Temple, or ſupreme Prince, was free;</hi> yet <note place="margin">Mat. 17. 24.</note> he wrought a <hi>miracle</hi> on purpoſe to defray it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the <hi>propagation of Chriſtianity</hi> was to out-laſt the <hi>immediate commiſſion</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> and <hi>Miracles;</hi> and to ſurvive in ordinary preaching and diſcourſe, while the Princes of the world were yet enemies to it.</p>
                     <p>What then does this argue? but that the enforcing of true pure Natural Religion only, is the right of Earthly Powers. Not the retrenching any of the Freedoms of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, not the impoſing any thing beſides and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, by power or penalties; not the forbidding of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of any corruptions invading it; not the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going any Revelation from Heaven, conſiſting with, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Natural Religion, (as all truly ſuch do) only the power of requiring all to live in obedience to, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that diſobey <hi>Natural Laws.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may be further ſaid, God intended Chriſtianity ſhould be brought in, <hi>not by might, not by power,</hi> but by <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>This is alſo moſt true, it appears God did ſo intend. But ſtill if Magiſtrates were intruſted by God with making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion Legal, or not Legal by their ſeal; it is plain, that Divine Ordination of Magiſtracy was diſhonour'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas'd by him that appointed it, in that it was not at all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of in ſo great an affair of the Divine Kingdom. And ſo far as they could judg, who did not believe, there was a real injury done to Powers, and the ſufferings of Chriſtians were on that account, juſt. For who could know that for ſo long a time God had ſuſpended that ſuppoſed Ordination of his, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Religion ſhould be brought into any State, or Kingdom, that had not firſt the favour and licenſe of the Laws and Magiſtrates of that State and Kingdom.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65165:40"/>
                     <p> But now ſuppoſe it is a ſtated Rule, that beyond Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion the Magiſtrates Power extends not; but (that being ſecur'd) there is a freedom to Subjects of taking care of their Souls, and wherein they have to do with God, as of their bodies, lives, or eſtates in private concerns; or as a Philoſopher hath of chuſing what he thinks the beſt ſyſtem and from the beſt Authors; and that men may freely reaſon herein, ſtill within the confinement of <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> Rever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus proportionably the caſe is the ſame concerning the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Christianity from Popery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We then that are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Chriſtians,</hi> have great reaſon to keep that door of the juſt and lawful propagation of Religion, not contrariant to <hi>Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> as open as we can; and to grant a quiet, <hi>comprehenſive of all offers</hi> that can be made, keeping within Rules of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Prudence;</hi> it ſeeming leſs hazard to admit thoſe inconveniences attendant upon this liberty, that through humane corruption run round with every thing, than thoſe greater miſchiefs of having Chriſtian or Proteſtant Religion violently kept out.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have endeavour'd to clear, that there are obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lying upon men precedent to any right of Humane Authority: <hi>viz.</hi> of duty to God, in obeying God rather than men; of the Profeſſion, Confeſſion, and publication of true Religion, however men forbid or ſcorn it; of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional communication of truth, as the Apoſtles ſaid, <hi>We</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The first foundation Christianity lays, is this, It propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the minds and conſciences of all its ſervants, Concerns of that vast moment and Rules of Action according to them;</hi> that whoever does ſincerely obſerve, and walk by them, ſhall be unavoidably carried <hi>upon love, and peace,</hi> and <hi>off from diviſion.</hi> It does not propoſe a <hi>ſett of opinions,</hi> that every one muſt come up to, though at a diſtance from theſe main concern; or a <hi>machine</hi> of <hi>bodily worſhip,</hi> that every one muſt learn the motions of; but it ſets down <hi>intereſts</hi> of ſuch <hi>indiſputable, worth</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> to be purſued, that do upon very great reaſons concenter Chriſtians in <hi>unity, love</hi> and <hi>peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. In that the ſpirits of men poſſeſs'd with them, are wiſe, weighty, generous, and manly: <hi>In malice, children; in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>men;</hi> that they can neither grow fierce, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and rigid, nor weakly, peeviſh, and querulous. Nay very much above this, their ſouls are holy, heavenly, aſpiring to God and Chriſt, that they are above ſmall things.</p>
                     <p>It is of great conſequence, what notions in Religion and Divine Things the mind feeds upon; for accordingly their temper will be. They that have with devotion faln upon old <hi>Jejune obſervances,</hi> (which they call Reverence of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) <hi>ſpinoſe</hi> Controverſies, opinions of <hi>zeal without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 9, 10.</note> a paſſionate affectionate Religion, <hi>not abounding in all judgment,</hi> and knowing <hi>the things that differ:</hi> Their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is apt to be moroſe and angry, or vexatious and full of complaint, if all be <hi>not of their meaſure;</hi> but they that
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65165:47"/> have their thoughts fixed on <hi>righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they are furniſhed with what is of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, they partake of the <hi>marrow,</hi> and <hi>fatneſs of Gods houſe, they drink of the river of his pleaſures;</hi> and are lightſome, <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 8.</note> benign, altogether for compaſſion, beneficence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in univerſal good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The purſuit of thoſe Intereſts gives them ſuch true employment, that they are not at leiſure to preſs trifles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, or be over attendant to them themſelves. They that are <hi>running this race, run ſo, that they may obtain;</hi> they <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 24.</note> that are <hi>fighting for this Crown do not love to beat the air;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 14.</note> they that are <hi>preſſing on for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt,</hi> are ſo taken up, all their ſinews are ſo ſtrain'd another way, that they cannot trifle themſelves, put others upon it, nor aſſume any thing in compariſon of what they are ſo intended upon.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That high value they have for the <hi>one thing neceſſary,</hi> gives ſuch an honourable character to all that are in the ſame manner affected, and imployed, that they cannot differ one with another in affection upon minute things. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and reverence they have for that Divine Image upon them, preſerves them from lightly ſpeaking or thinking ill one of another.</p>
                     <p>Now in theſe three things, to have Spirits of an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, Solid, Benign Temper, attending great and worthy Objects; in having a full, generous and noble Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in a great and honourable Eſteem of Chriſtians, for true Chriſtianities ſake, lye the true ſeeds of Chriſtian Peace.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore bring theſe things to to their juſt Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-Rule, as in innumerable expreſſions of Scripture it is ſilently pointed at; but in two more expreſly, and in both, as the very ſtandard of Peace.</p>

                     <p> The Firſt is that which hath fallen lately under ſo much debate: <hi>let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> beginning this Chapter with an exhortation <note place="margin">Ver. 1, &amp;c.</note> to <hi>rejoice in God,</hi> and in that <hi>excellent ſtate of Chriſtianity</hi> into which they were brought, immediately had his eye upon the <hi>Legaliſts,</hi> that <hi>troubled thoſe clear waters,</hi> and damp'd the joy of Chriſtians; a point he was much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and very ſafe for them often to hear.

                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, you need not fear they are <note place="margin">Ver. 3.</note> gone away with the <hi>birthright</hi> and <hi>bleſſing</hi> of <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> We are the <hi>true Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>Wherein he appears (as in a moſt lively ſcheme), <hi>Firſt,</hi> A <hi>Jew</hi> of the greateſt advantages without Chriſt, and yet worth nothing. Then a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> enrich'd as a <hi>Merchant</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ver. 8, 9.</note> with the <hi>Pearl of great price:</hi> in himſelf, I ſay, appears a <hi>Jew</hi> of the higheſt alloy; in himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of the <hi>firſt three;</hi> in both he ſhews the worthleſneſs of <hi>all out of Chriſt,</hi> the infinite Riches to be <hi>found in Chriſt.</hi> And after this <note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> he exemplifies ſtill in himſelf the high and moſt important buſineſs of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in all thoſe moſt Eloquent, Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant and Ponderous Expreſſions, that I cannot ſo much as glance upon, being too mighty for a long and ſet diſcourſe, much more for a ſhort one, and in paſſage.</p>
                     <p>Having done all this, he now applies it to the preſent <note place="margin">Ver. 15, 16.</note> caſe of Chriſtians, whom he ranks into two degrees.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The weaker Chriſtians, whom the Apoſtle very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and tacitely ſignifies, by thoſe that do <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65165:49"/>
                     <p> To the Second he allows, Firſt, All the <hi>Tolleration</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> till, and confidently foretells, <hi>God will reveal even this to them,</hi> viz. not only the ſupreme excellency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but the total <hi>uſeleſneſs,</hi> and <hi>utter abolition</hi> of thoſe Ceremonies.</p>
                     <p>But in the Second place he preſſes them on ſo far as they had attained, <hi>viz.</hi> to a ſenſe of the <hi>incomparable excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of <hi>the knowledg of Chriſt, to a conformity in his Death and Reſurrection;</hi> and that they would <hi>walk by that one Rule,</hi> that they would adjuſt all their Actions and Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the <hi>perfect Chriſtian,</hi> and mind that ſame thing, though they cannot lay aſide all regard to other things immediately of that lower Rate.</p>
                     <p>Here then is the Chriſtians Rule of governing himſelf as a Chriſtian, and it brings forth certain Peace.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     </p>
                     <p>If any man hath not <hi>attained this Rule,</hi> he is either no Chriſtian, or under the diſguiſe of one, (if he be an <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Here is the one <hi>ſame Rule</hi> by which all Chriſtians are to walk: here is the <hi>one thing</hi> they are all to <hi>mind.</hi> Here is no allowance, no tolleration, here it is they are all to be ſo ſerious, of ſuch excellent Spirits, to have ſuch a value one of another, as to be able to center in Univerſal <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> upon this point.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Every <hi>perfect man</hi> is not to take in any thing of a lower kind, of a forreign extract, into ſo Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65165:49"/> a Religion, that he may wholly and without any allocation to any thing elſe, mind this <hi>ſame thing:</hi> This makes him a more wiſe, a more perfect, manly and <hi>full ag'd Chriſtian;</hi> more Spiritual and Divine, and more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to keep the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The overowning any way, party, or perſon, takes off ſo from the Excellency of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> as to render him <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>Childiſh:</hi> I could not (ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle) ſpeak to you, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Chriſt;</hi> you are ſo <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12.</note> over-zealous for men, and make <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf as if he were but the <hi>Head of a Party.</hi>

                     <p>And this is moſt neceſſary in order to Peace, ſeeing ſuch infirmities are natural to this low ſtate, <hi>even of Chriſtians</hi> in this world.</p>
                     <p>Wherein they that are ſcrupulous, muſt take heed of judging the wiſer, as diſorderly, irregular, and almoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, if they do not obſerve their Rites; and the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought as carefully to preſerve themſelves from deſpiſing the ſcrupulous, as <hi>fond ſuperſtitioniſts,</hi> becauſe they can't neglect them.

                     </p>
                     <p>This alſo is to be added as obſervable, that the caſe of the weakneſs of the firſt Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>tians can never recur exactly; for thoſe Ceremonies being of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> had juſt claim to an awe upon Conſciences, not as yet clear in their repeal; whereas all later Rites can pretend no higher than humane inſtitution, cuſtome, or venerable antiquity; for the ſuſpition of <hi>Apostolick Inſtitution</hi> in their behalf, and ſo adding Religion to them, I look upon as much weaker and worſe, ſeeing we have no Authentick Records of ſuch Inſtitutions; and in things of ſo dilute a goodneſs, as Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies muſt be, there will not be a ballance to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite danger of leaning a Religious weight upon a <hi>broken Reed,</hi> that both <hi>pierces,</hi> and <hi>deceives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it may be ſaid, Is not the ſcrupulous forbearing, the being ſcar'd and terrified at Ceremonies, as great a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as being over anxious in their obſervation?</p>
                     <p>Does not the placing a point of Religion in an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of them, and thinking <hi>ones ſelf the better</hi> for not uſing them, detract as much from minding this ſame thing, and walking by the ſame Rule, as the other ſide ſolicitude?</p>
                     <p>No doubt it does, if we juſtly explain and limit in the caſe; and therefore for the reſolving this queſtion, I will obſerve the importance of this ſame <hi>Rule,</hi> given us by the Apoſtle in another of his Epiſtles, a place very parallel to the ſenſe, and much of the ſame expreſſion with this to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> the right explication of which will alſo much confirm the expoſition given of <hi>this Rule,</hi> ſeeing as I ſaid, they are both one and the <hi>ſame Rule:</hi> and it is that we find, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14, 15, 16.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And as many as walk by this rule;</hi> viz. a making the <hi>new creature in Chriſt,</hi> All; and every thing elſe Nothing: and who act according to it, <hi>the peace and mercy of God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all <hi>true Chriſtians,</hi> be upon them; for they are the <hi>true Iſrael of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65165:51"/>
                     <p> And ſo it is plain, If any man makes the other ſide of a <hi>Ceremony,</hi> the not obſerving it, a point of Real, Subſtantial Religion to him, is afraid of it, and values that <hi>fear</hi> as a <hi>fear of God,</hi> without the more intrinſick parts and effects of that Fear, he errs from Chriſtianity, as the Bigot for Ceremonies does.</p>
                     <p>But this does not imply, every one that preſerves, and will not recede from his liberty, though he knows the <hi>true uſe</hi> and <hi>diſuſe</hi> of <hi>all things indifferent,</hi> yet will not be cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially bound by any on earth, is preſently afraid of a Ceremony, or that he is ſo, becauſe he will not ſet it too near Divine Inſtitutions in his practiſe, or incumber his worſhip of God with it, though it be told him never ſo often; There is no Religion in the Impoſition, but Order, Decency, or Submiſſion to Government.</p>
                     <p>All this does not argue, he makes it a point of Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Religion not to endure Ceremonies, which he eſteems himſelf <hi>neither the better,</hi> nor <hi>the worſe;</hi> but places all in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>New Creature, to commend him to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus we have the Firſt, and very Deepeſt Foundation for True Chriſtian Peace, lying in the abſolute ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Religion of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſubſtantially good, even as the <hi>Eternal Laws of Goodneſs,</hi> and perfecting the ſoul of man into them, and the enjoyment of God in them; and the Heart, and Life ſtretched out in the utmoſt purſuit, with the ſame intenſneſs, that men <hi>ſtrive for maſteries,</hi> and taking nothing ceremonial into any degree of this value, if into any at all, as <hi>the full-grown Chriſtian</hi> does not. This is the <hi>True Rule of Chriſtianity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>this Rule,</hi> even as to that to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and to the <hi>Philippians, is one and the ſame Rule,</hi> and given into every Chriſtians hand to judg and walk by, with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription upon it, <hi>Whoever lives and acts by this ſame Rule,</hi> though he may require toleration in ſome things that God may in <hi>time reveal to him;</hi> yet he is, together with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65165:51"/> the <hi>Iſrael of God;</hi> built <hi>as a City compact together, at unity and at peace with it ſelf.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And who that looks upon <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and this <hi>Rule of it,</hi> can but be amaz'd, <hi>Eſſential Chriſtianity</hi> ſhould not draw up the intire Love and Zeal of Chriſtians to it, ſo that they ſhould only provoke one another <hi>to love and good works,</hi> and ſo value one another in it, as to be united and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led above and beyond all other <hi>Bitterneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this firſt Head I have been inſiſting upon, is that in which Chriſtians have all <hi>one judgment,</hi> and <hi>ſpeaks</hi> one <hi>and the ſame thing,</hi> and ſo admits not the leaſt variation. Here all the lines of <hi>Chriſtian Revealed Religion</hi> meet, no Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point that is not included in this Rule.</p>
                     <p>For He to <hi>whoſe Image</hi> there muſt be ſuch a <hi>conformity,</hi> muſt be the <hi>Son of God;</hi> He that was <hi>crucified</hi> muſt be <hi>man.</hi> All purity from ſin, and vigor of the Divine Life, muſt be found where there is the <hi>power of his death</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.</hi> The <hi>whole glory</hi> of <hi>ſelf-confidence, ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, worldly pomp and vanity,</hi> muſt be <hi>crucified,</hi> where there is <hi>the fellowſhip of his ſufferings;</hi> where <hi>the glory is only in his croſs;</hi> where <hi>the world is crucified to a man,</hi> and <hi>a man to the world;</hi> where there is a reaching forth to the utmoſt, to attain <hi>the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> and a <hi>preſſing forward for the price of the high calling of God in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> there muſt be the Doctrine of <hi>Eternal life;</hi> in <hi>his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> lye treaſured <hi>all the glories of the future ſtate;</hi> and where theſe things are urg'd as under ſo great neceſſity, there muſt be an extremity of evils on the other ſide, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the <hi>wrath to come.</hi> They then that are agreed here, may well tolerate one another in leſſer differences, while theſe things are not ſubverted, over-preſſed, or defeated by other additions.

The ſecond Head under which may be diſcourſed the Efficacy of <hi>True Chriſtian Religion</hi> to Peace, is, That in Chriſtianity there is an <hi>uniting ſpirit of Love,</hi> flowing from thoſe ſeveral points of Union, wherein Chriſtians are cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one with another conjoyned, and compacted, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in a truly Divine Peace.</p>
                     <p>For the principal, internal tye of Union is, <hi>that one ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> this one ſpirit conveys it ſelf, and runs through the whole body of all Chriſtians, <hi>in Love, and ſo in Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Love is the Bond of <hi>Perfectneſs,</hi> that is, of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of this whole body:</hi> for ſo I ſhould chooſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound <note place="margin">Col. 3. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>that Perfectneſs,</hi> becauſe the Apoſtle had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to all thoſe Graces that do moſt conſerve the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the body; <hi>bowels of Mercy, Goodneſs, Humbleneſs, Meekneſs, Patience, forbearance one of another, forgiveneſs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">v. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>one of another; if any one have a quarrel againſt another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Chriſt forgave: but above all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>put on Love which is the bond of perfectneſs; and let the Peace of God rule in your hearts, unto which ye are called in one body:</hi> So here is the Love that is the <hi>Bond</hi> of the <hi>Integrity</hi> of the <hi>body;</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> conſequent upon it, unto which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are called in one body;</hi> and both of them guarded with all thoſe uniting, healing Vertues of Chriſtianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Love and Peace are moſt cheriſh'd, conſerv'd and ſecur'd. Peace it ſelf is the <hi>Bond of that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> that is, of that real effective Union the Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhes, by vertue of which the parts all reſt in ſtrict com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination one with nother: this Peace is the cloſe reſt of the parts, by which every one adheres with greateſt kindneſs to each other, and deſire of ſelf-preſervation in the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole; and ſo all the parts ſeek the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſituation each of other, and abhor the diſturbance, the diſeaſe of any.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe this Peace cannot procure or conſerve it ſelf, ſeeing it is not a dull ſluggiſh Reſt, but in the midſt of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65165:52"/> Motion and Action, Love is (as I may call it) the Divine <hi>Archeus,</hi> that Divine <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> the great Inſtrument of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> the ſupreme Author of <hi>this Love</hi> and <hi>Peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And Love runs every way, pries into all the cauſes of Diviſion, and removes them, ſees into all the ways of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliating, and effectually purſues them.</p>
                     <p>This is that Love, that edifies the body, it takes off all the aſperities and roughneſs of the parts, thoſe particular ſharp angularities of Opinion, reduces them to a ſquare, to a Figure fitted one to another, and then cements, and ties them one to another, till they grow <hi>into a ſpiritual Temple.</hi> What incomparable Virtues to this purpoſe, does the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle at large, and with greateſt ſpeciality, expreſs in that Divine Treatiſe of Love, 1 Cor. 13. <hi>All knowledg without</hi>

                        <hi>this is nothing,</hi> of what ſort ſoever it be: That only <hi>puffs up and ſwells men,</hi> as if they themſelves were All, as if they could themſelves be an Intire Temple, a Spiritual Building alone; the <hi>underſtanding all Myſteries,</hi> it makes a man look to himſelf like the <hi>whole Body of Chriſt,</hi> or at leaſt, as if he were to determine the poſture, and figure of the whole, and all the other parts to obey, and be contented with the room he leaves. We know this is the general temper of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, the product of <hi>Knowledg</hi> without <hi>Love.</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg therefore alone cannot build. Airy Knowledg is big, boiſterous, angry, if it be not admir'd, if it be not venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo, as to take up what ſpace it pleaſes, to order as it pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>Even the <hi>following of the Truth,</hi> the earneſt ſearch after, and <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 15.</note> purſuit of what is True, a much more excellent thing than meer Knowledg; yet if this be not in <hi>love,</hi> there cannot be a <hi>growing up into the Head in all things, even Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Love</hi> then, is that which takes care of all the members, of all the <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> how they may all moſt comply with, and advance each other, and reſt in their peaceable conformity

                     <p>Now this <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> are ſpiritual, and intellectual, and they therefore are fix'd upon a complication of <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intellectual Centers</hi> (if I may ſo expreſs them) all the Right True Lines from which, and returns to which, are in <hi>Love and Peace.</hi> And theſe are thoſe ſeveral points of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle hath laid together, Epheſ. 4. 4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one Body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God, and Father of All, who is above All, and through All, and in you All.</hi>

                     <p>It is not in pomp of Speculation and opinion always di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputations, and quarrelſome if <hi>without love,</hi> but <hi>a worthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding of love</hi> in all <hi>knowledg</hi> and <hi>judgment,</hi> ſo as not to be a Blind, Ignorant, Dull Affection.</p>
                     <p>Not in Models, or Forms, Rites or Ceremonies, of no value in this <hi>ſpiritual frame,</hi> when once they get paſt natural Order and Decency; but like nice Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Art, very often is all broken in pieces, in the twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to comply with it; and when it is brought to paſs, rather Fine than Solid, and of no Duration.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now as the Apoſtle ſays, intending this <hi>Myſtical Body</hi> eſpecially, <hi>If the Foot ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the Head, I</hi>

                        <hi>Body as it hath pleaſed him, giving more abundant honour to that part which lacked, that there ſhould be no Schiſm in the Body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one for another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle, I confeſs, is ſpeaking of the order of Higher and Lower, Honourable and leſs Honourable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, under the reſemblance of the natural graduations in the members of the Body.</p>
                     <p>But the reaſon being taken from the Laws of each Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, argues, It is no caſe at the arbitrement of any who ſhall be of <hi>this Body,</hi> but as that <hi>Law of Chriſt</hi> hath defin'd, and ſo far as that Law hath extended that <hi>Body,</hi> ſo far the love and care of it, and for it, muſt go, elſe there will be <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Seeing there is not elſe that proper care of the members, who muſt according to the Laws of the Body, be members, whether one or other pleaſe to have it ſo.</p>
                     <p>Thus then I ſuppoſe, there is a Society, or Societies of Chriſtians, in this or any part of the world; <hi>they hold Chriſt the Head;</hi> they hold thoſe <hi>great points of union</hi> I have been <note place="margin">Col. 2. 19.</note> ſpeaking of; they are not chargeable with opinions or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes plainly contrary, or undermining thoſe acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein, though they may be guilry of errors in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Practice;</hi> yet not ſo Fundamental, as to tear them off from the Body, or make them another Body; or they are miſunderſtood to hold ſuch errors, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do not, or they are not errors: or they refuſe to

                     <p>In this caſe, I ſay, he is the only Schiſmatick that hath not a <hi>love,</hi> that hath not a <hi>ſympathy</hi> with the Body; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if neither party hath, they muſt be both <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There may be Modeſt, Peaceable Diſſents, and different practiſes upon them: There were ſuch notorious enough among the Firſt Chriſtians, as the Apoſtle plainly diſcourſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. for he ſays, <hi>They that eat, eat to the Lord, and give God thanks: they that eat not, yet ſtill to the Lord they eat</hi>

                        <hi>not, and give God thanks:</hi> One for his Religious eating, the other for his Chriſtian Liberty. Here are acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in which there could be no Uniformity, they could not joyn one with another.</p>
                     <p>So, <hi>He that regardeth the day, to the Lord he regardeth it: he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he regardeth it not.</hi> Here again are acts of Reverence of God, but there's no Uniformity; yet ſtill the Apoſtle <hi>(Rom.</hi> 15. 5.) ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and exhorts, that in the midſt of theſe differences in which he had poſitively made an allowance to each part, they would yet <hi>be like-minded one to another, according to Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> after his Exemplar, or having their eye upon the ſame <hi>Image of Chriſt</hi> inſtamped on both.</p>
                     <p>Yea, and notwithſtanding theſe Diſcords, he ſuppoſeth they <hi>might with one mind and one mouth glorifie God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> both in thoſe common <note place="margin">Ver. 6.</note> things wherein both agreed, and were perfectly <hi>one;</hi> and alſo in thoſe things wherein they had one common Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Deſign, <hi>center'd in the one point of doing all to the Lord;</hi> whether they <hi>eat,</hi> or <hi>eat not;</hi> whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>us, to the glory of God,</hi> notwithſtanding our many faults. So Chriſtians, notwithſtanding the faults they truly, or miſtakingly eſteem ſo in one another; yet ſtill they ſhould own one another as Chriſtians; they ſhould mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally partake the benefits of one anothers Chriſtianity, and the publique adminiſtrations of it as to the things wherein they are as one, and even in the things they diſſent, in this conſpire; in the direction of all to the glory of God. All this plainly ſhews, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> conſiſts not in <hi>

                     <p>And indeed, he that being a Chriſtian, deprives himſelf <hi>of the abundance of the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the Goſpel,</hi> running every way among Chriſtians, or of the mutual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment they make of <hi>ſpiritual gifts and graces one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> upon the account of ſmall differences only, is unthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the advantages offer'd to him by God, and ſtraitens to himſelf, the Divine Spirit in its free emanations every way, and throughout all the members of Chriſt, without attending our ſinful differences, which are no rule at all of its effuſions or reſtraints, when it flows among all that are true <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> it doth not conſider in its gifts, that one party is by it ſelf, another by it ſelf, but gives to all that are truly of <hi>Chriſts Body;</hi> yet the ſinful ſeverity of one party, and too often of both, may <hi>diſpleaſe, grieve,</hi> and in great Degrees <hi>quench the Holy Spirit</hi> in its donations, as <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 5. 19.</note> to one, or both guilty parties.</p>
                     <p>And indeed this is another of thoſe things that does more truly import <hi>Schiſm,</hi> than external differences do; when thoſe that are truly Members of the ſame Body, do deny to yeild, to convey, or to receive, and give Circulation
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65165:57"/> to the Communications of the Divine Spirit through the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>For thus men may become putrid, gangren'd, or mortified Members, and ſo deſerve to be <hi>cut off;</hi> not for their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſentiments, which ought to be tollerated, but for that they will not <hi>Communicate,</hi> or <hi>will not be Communicated</hi> with; they will not <hi>give</hi> or <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Gifts Chriſt hath gi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven</hi>

                     <p>A wiſe Chriſtian does not deprive himſelf in his private Freedoms of true Reaſon, or Chriſtian ſenſe, though he culls it out of much droſs; nor of the benefits of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an worſhip, where he may find Good, if the worſhip be not ſo corrupted, that one cannot be ſeparate from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There's a general Charity and Tolleration muſt be of humane infirmity in the beſt adminiſtration of it by men, for there is a <hi>charge</hi> of our <hi>Folly</hi> upon all our appearances before God, viſible not only to God, who <hi>charges his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels with it,</hi> but to our ſelves; ſo that if <hi>Angels hide their faces,</hi> much more thoſe whoſe <hi>houſes are of clay,</hi> and <hi>their foundation in the dust.</hi> Yet there are advantages of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation that are indeed to be had, for which we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God, and ſo our withdrawing our ſelves, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out juſt Cauſe) and the degrees of our withdrawing ſhall be accounted <hi>Schiſm.</hi> But of this, and what may be objected in theſe caſes, more may be ſpoken under the next Head.</p>
                     <p>If any man indeed from want of Love, and with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to divide, ſcatters, and ſows Opinions, or <hi>cauſes Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,</hi> is an Enginere of Diviſion: Such a man hath the true Spirit of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and is to be mark'd and avoided, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17.</p>

But ſtill in all caſes there muſt be a <hi>care for the body,</hi> and he that withdraws is in danger, and that for the withdrawing, not for the different apprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>Men may withdraw in ſome points of outward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, we ſee they may locally ſeparate on occaſion; they may deny to conform to what they think amiſs, as one Member is not bound to deform or wound it ſelf, that it may be Uniform with another, that is ſo wounded, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>There may be very different Motions, and ordering the ſeveral Members on ſundry accounts, yet <hi>no Schiſm.</hi>

                     <p>It may be ſaid, <hi>Are theſe not of the Body therefore?</hi> or thoſe not of the <hi>Body therefore,</hi> becauſe in ſome thing they differ, when both parts <hi>hold the Head,</hi> and are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Head?</hi>

                     <p>What can be ſaid againſt it? but that the Laws of men interpoſing, or the Laws of particular Churches interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, make a difference betwixt the caſe of Chriſtians now, and in the times in which the Apoſtles writ: and that now ſuch variations from the Obedience and Conformity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by thoſe Laws, become <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> meerly for the Diſobedience ſake, which ſhall be preſum'd proof ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of the want of love and care for the Body, and not the want of Love conſtitute the Schiſm; ſo that wherever the diſagreement in Judgment is, there ſhall be the Schiſm ſure enough; whatever the Love, and the Indications of it are in all other ſigns, tokens, and effects of it.</p>

                     <p>But ſhall the Laws of men thus make obſolete the Laws of Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>It is not any Law, nor an Offence againſt any Law, but the Law of Chriſt, nor againſt every Law of Chriſt, but the Laws concerning the Unity of his Body, that can make a Schiſm; nor does a Congregation, or a Multitude deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine where the Schiſm lyes, when there is a difference, or a Diviſion among Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>For as one man holding the ſubſtantials of Chriſtianity, is more a Church than a Community, erring in thoſe Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals; ſo is one Chriſtian full of the Love of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt,</hi> moſt willing to do, and receive good, more truly of the Body, than Aſſociations fill'd with <hi>Anger, Wrath, Clamor,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Indignation,</hi> without Mercy, without Compaſſion, who are indeed in their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion more <hi>Schiſmatical</hi> than the humble ſolitary Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that cannot run with this ſtream.</p>
                     <p>For theſe things are not carried, nor determined by number, but by true weight and worth; as one wiſe man is more a Senate than a Convention of fooliſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing men.</p>
                     <p>By all this that hath been ſpoken, it may be determined, what Anſwer is to be given to that Queſtion, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as it is call'd) be a true Church: to which the Anſwer I ſhould give, would be plainly this.</p>
                     <p>It is no otherwiſe ſo, than a married woman that is an Adultereſs, is a true Wife.</p>
                     <p>I ſay, not a true Woman; for the importance of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is more Phyſical, and ſo in this caſe more ambiguous;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65165:59"/> the ſenſe of <hi>wife,</hi> more befitting the <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>myſtical</hi> ſenſe of <hi>Church;</hi> and the one not made uſe of by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theſe caſes, the other conſtantly call'd for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the <hi>true</hi> or <hi>falſe Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to keep more cloſe to what we have been upon, let me put the queſtion thus: Whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be a part of this <hi>one Body of Chriſt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is moſt evident, if we look upon it as ſuch an Incorporation, ſuch a Body as it is in, and by it ſelf, it is not, it cannot be other than a <hi>Synagogue of Satan.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſo it is a Body conſolidated upon other points of Union, than the Body of Chriſt is; for though it takes in them, yet it adds foreign, and aliene of its own, and thoſe very many, and ſuch as deſtroy, if not all, yet ſome of the principal, by ſuch a deep corruption of them chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them ſo, that they cannot be known to be the true ones, or alike <hi>precious Fundamentals laid by Chriſt Jeſus and his Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is a Body animated with another ſpirit, the very <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Antichriſt;</hi> a ſpirit of blood and cruelty, againſt all that keep to the <hi>true meaſures</hi> of the <hi>Temple and Altar of</hi>

To theſe we may allow the charitable hopes of Salvation, not for their <hi>Popiſh tincture,</hi> but for their Chriſtianity. For all that is <hi>Popiſh</hi> is their danger, and their extreme danger.

                     <p> And thus I have ſetled the ſecond Head of Diſcourſe concerning the efficacy of <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to peace; <hi>That Divine Balſom of love</hi> running throughout the Body, and particularly to the agrieved parts, where there is an <hi>union</hi> upon the Fundamental <hi>

                     <p>I come now to the Third Head of Chriſtian Peace.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>The Rules Chriſtianity gives the true Profeſſors of it, for the imbodying themſelves one with another, will ſhew how ſincerely it deſigns peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſome may think if there be no obligation of mutual Conformity in particular ſocieties of Chriſtians, how can there be any ſuch Societies? if there may be ſuch Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among Chriſtians, as that there be not requir'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in all points of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Practiſe, under peril of the dreadful ſin of Schiſm, Chriſtianity will be like a <hi>general notion,</hi> ſubſiſting in no <hi>diſtinct particular bodies;</hi> or like an univerſe of Atoms without any connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and then how can they that have nothing to do one with another, be at peace one with another. If there be no aſſociations of Chriſtians, no Churches particularly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conſtituted, there is no opportunity to practiſe that peace and ſubmiſſion to order, which ſuch Societies oblige to, and which the <hi>Apostle</hi> rejoiced to behold in the Church of the <hi>Coloſſians.</hi> If all the love and peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be only that which is extended to the <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore now addreſs my ſelf to conſider the Laws of Chriſtianity, for Chriſtians ſo imbodying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may diſplay all the <hi>general vertues of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi>

                        <hi>in their particular ſtations in the Churches of Chriſt;</hi> and ſo I ſhall lay down theſe three Rules concerning this very weighty Point.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That the firſt Congregating of Chriſtians is to Chriſt himſelf,</hi> as to the <hi>Head,</hi> in whom the <hi>whole Body is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally united,</hi> and the Union with him is the Meaſure, and true Law of their Union one with another, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> joyns their <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Faith in Christ</hi> together: they give themſelves, firſt to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and then to one another: <note place="margin">Col. 2. 5.</note> This was the Apoſtles method to preach, <hi>firſt Christ Jeſus to be the Lord,</hi> and <hi>themſelves Servants for Christs ſake.</hi> All <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 5.</note> Chriſtians are firſt Converted to the <hi>Faith of Christ,</hi> and <hi>ſo added to the Church.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Acts 2. 44, 47.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is moſt neceſſary to be conſidered, becauſe if the firſt <hi>gathering of Chriſtians</hi> were to the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> would be the <hi>Rule</hi> of all their <hi>after-Action,</hi> and <hi>Regulation</hi> of themſelves, and they muſt take every thing on truſt from that; but if the firſt <hi>Point of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion be Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Faith in him,</hi> that ſhall over-rule, wherein ſoever a <hi>Church</hi> may deviate from the <hi>Laws of Chriſt,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. From hence alſo it follows, that the Union of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is, firſt with the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Now thus far I have already ſhown, There is as firm a Foundation of Peace laid, as the Underſtanding of man can conceive in this ſtate of things here below in a dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate world of humane nature.</p>

But beſides this, there are <hi>particular Aſſemblies</hi> that are nearer to Chriſtians in particular, and to which they ought to Unite, as either having received the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity by their Miniſtry, and ſo having been to them one of <hi>thoſe Pillars</hi> to which the Chriſtian Doctrine being affixed, it hath offered it to all Comers, and to them in particular.

All theſe, or any of theſe, may create an obligation to ſuch conjunctions.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the hotteſt diſputes in relation to Chriſtian Practiſe, ſo as to conſerve <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> have riſen in this very <hi>juncture</hi> of <hi>particular Societies of Christians:</hi> I will endeavour to ſettle upon an indiſputable ſtate of things, and leave out what is more intricate, and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, that we may ſee how far the Laws of Chriſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here to <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> in theſe following Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That <hi>Our Lord hath given Rules</hi> for ſuch <hi>Holy, Grave,</hi> and <hi>Honourable Societies,</hi> under the name of Churches, as muſt needs invite all of the ſame excellent <hi>Christian Temper,</hi> into their Communion, according to the opportunities they have to joyn with them, their Doctrine, Worſhip, and Practice, ſo Pure, and Heavenly, ſo evidently for the good of mens ſouls, ſo compoſed to all <hi>true Decency, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>

How then does it ſeem poſſible, that when there are ſuch Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Chriſtians ſhould not fly to them, as the <hi>Doves to the windows;</hi> ſeeing Chriſtianity improves the ſociableneſs of Humanity into the trueſt publickneſs of Spirit, and deſire to enjoy Good with more than in <hi>ſolitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>It is the expreſs Command of Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>deſign in all his inſtitutions, that there ſhould be ſuch Aſſemblies of his people,</hi> and ſervants, for the <hi>Glory of his Father,</hi> for his <hi>own Glory,</hi> for the <hi>Salvation of his People,</hi> for <hi>Divine worſhip,</hi> for the diſcharge of the ſeveral <hi>Duties of Chriſtians,</hi> for the Communications of <hi>their Gifts and Graces:</hi> ſo that the <hi>forſaking</hi> of the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of our ſelves together, as <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 25.</note> the <hi>manner of ſome was,</hi> is very little diſtant <hi>from Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy it ſelf:</hi> How can there then be but <hi>Churches,</hi> where there are Chriſtians, ſeeing ſo much of the concerns of Chriſtianity lye therein? and who indeed poſſeſs'd with thoſe concerns does not rejoice in them, and <hi>bleſs God for his unſpeakable Gift,</hi> in the Conſtitution of them?</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p>But if this cannot be obtained, the next Beſt, and that which is indeed, as I have already made out, but <hi>Juſt,</hi> is, That no native Rights and Liberties be defaulked, nor puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive oppreſſions inflicted, but that the Honorary Rewards of Nations and Princes be adjudged to men who are of the <hi>Publique Sentiment</hi> in their Adminiſtrations in <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion.</hi> And this indeed cannot be excepted to, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Right of National Powers</hi> to diſpoſe of their <hi>own</hi> according to their own Reaſon and Judgment.</p>

                     <p> Yet is there ſtill an obligation upon <hi>Chriſtian ſubjects,</hi> beyond theſe Conſiderations to examine all things with the greateſt prejudice for, and on the ſide of the <hi>National ſenſe,</hi> eſpecially when they find the <hi>ſubſtantials of Religion</hi> ſecure, and in ſafety; and beſides their private adjuſtments of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian performances in particular Societies, according to the exacter Rules of Chriſtianity, as they are Judges for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to encourage, alſo promote, and as far as poſſibly they can, communicate with <hi>National</hi> Religion, putting the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and kindeſt <hi>interpretation,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> upon all things, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating all that can without diſobedience to God be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; obſerving Rites and Cuſtoms of Nations, as far as they can with ſecurity, <hi>from vain worſhipping of God</hi> by the <hi>commandments of men,</hi> both becauſe of the Honour Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity gives to Magiſtracy according to <hi>Natural ſanctions;</hi> and alſo, and more eſpecially becauſe of the eſteem Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity hath of a <hi>Publique</hi> and <hi>National Religion.</hi>

                     <p>On one ſide men have made Religion a cover and ſhelter for Sedition, Rebellion, Commotion and Change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:65165:69"/> perfectly againſt the whole deſign of it.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, Wordly Powers have charg'd all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of a Religion never ſo true, never ſo peaceable, as if it was bringing out the Engines of Deſtruction, for the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up States, and therefore judg'd moſt reaſonable, the Authors and <hi>Proſelytes</hi> of it ſhould be purſued with ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt puniſhments.</p>
                     <p>And without any Relation to theſe Concernments, the very different apprehenſions in Religion have been thought worthy of the extreameſt Hate, and moſt barbarous Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of Racks, Wheels, and Tortures, as if men having deſtin'd one another <hi>to Hell in another world</hi> on theſe accounts, thought it but fit the <hi>Hell</hi> ſhould be begun here; or elſe (which hath been ſometimes a pretence for this ſavage me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,) they would <hi>pull them with violence</hi> (indeed) <hi>out of that fire, or ſave them from thoſe flames,</hi> yet <hi>ſo as by fire;</hi> cruelly forcing them thereby into the Religion of their Judges.</p>
                     <p>Now how contrary this is to the nature of True, Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or Chriſtian Religion, I have all along ſhewn.</p>
                     <p>But however multitudes of the Votaries of Religion, whether true or falſe, have with incredible patience, and oftentimes with joy and triumph embrac'd their ſufferings, and gloried in their death and torments; eſteeming their pains, <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> a name of honour in this world, and of great expectations in the <hi>world future.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that a very conſiderable part of Story is fill'd up with great undertakings upon account of Religion, with the ſeverity of Laws againſt any thing ſtrange, or innovated in the profeſſion of Nations, and the <hi>Martyrologies</hi> of thoſe that have ſuffer'd for being otherwiſe perſwaded.</p>
                     <p>Now if a man values and eſtimates things by this worlds peace, happineſs, and quiet, he would be ready to praiſe and applaud Atheiſm and Irreligion, and wiſh there never had been the name or notion of any other in the world, to

                     <p>Eſpecially conſidering the Chriſtian Religion, the moſt excellent tender Religion, moſt compaſſionate of Humane Nature; moſt Clear, Intelligible, Rational, Vertuous, freeſt from Ceremony, moſt aliene from Superſtition, moſt modeſt and humble, moſt ſubmiſſive to Government, at its firſt entrances into the world endur'd the whole weight and body of malice and cruelty againſt it; was ſown in the <hi>Blood,</hi> and grew up as from the <hi>Graves of the Confeſſors and Martyrs of it,</hi> being firſt founded in the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> though he indeed gave proof of the Truth and laſt iſſue of it in a <hi>Glorious Reſurrection.</hi>

                     <p>In ſum, this of all Religions hath been firſt moſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, hated, and oppos'd by Grandees and Chiefs of the world in its firſt approaches to the world, and ſince by the ſeveral Diſſentions within it ſelf, been the <hi>Field of Blood,</hi> made uſe of ſometimes by deſign, ſometimes by angry power; but ſo, as that the pureſt and moſt ſincere Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors have been moſtly dyed in their own gore; ſo that by the ſame ſtandard of worldly intereſt, next to Atheiſm and Irreligion, <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> or denial of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would ſeem next to be choſen.</p>

                     <p>But yet this is not anſwer enough for the defiling the <hi>very light,</hi> and the <hi>Sun;</hi> even Religion it ſelf; and that in ſo great degrees, and to ſo heinouſly contrary ends; for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:65165:70"/> whereas the very height and tranſcendency of Divine Things might in all reaſon plead an exemption from ſuch debaſements, yet coming ſo near to our corrupted <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaere,</hi> it is even as the very light, though in it ſelf remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always pure and clear as it ſelf, notwithſtanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by men to their own abominable impieties.</p>
                     <p>This then alone anſwers ſo great a Doubt, That God is exceedingly offended and diſpleas'd with <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> that ſo excellent an inſtrument of the Divine Glory, the Happineſs of the world in preſent, and the eternal life and happineſs of it hereafter, ſhould be depraved into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of greateſt unhappineſs and miſchief to mankind, both <hi>in this world,</hi> and <hi>that which is to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For ſo far as we can ſee, much of that Blood and Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tumult and Convulſion, much of the Cruelty and Inhumanity that hath fallen out, had been ſav'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, had it not been that Religion had a place in the world.</p>
                     <p>Much of that deep and almoſt inexpiable guilt that hath been contracted through the perſecution of the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and oppoſition to it from the falſe, had never come into account now, or at the <hi>day of Judgment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is therefore evident upon the whole ſtate of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> that though there is a main difference in regard of the goodneſs of God in the Mediator, between it and the <hi>Angelick Nature fallen,</hi> that one is univerſally in <hi>chains of darkneſs to the Judgment of the great Day;</hi> and without hopes of remedy; the other not univerſally, nor <hi>without hope:</hi> Yet thoſe <hi>chains</hi> are due to the one, even as to the other, and in what degrees to the Divine Juſtice in its wiſdom it ſeems meet, it caſts men into them; even as it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributes as it pleaſes, meaſures of the puniſhment of ſin, in taking the forfeitures of the Bleſſings of Earth of ſome, and not of others, when it was given to the children of men alike as to their ſubſtantial enjoyment, however <hi>one might</hi>
                        <pb n="132" facs="tcp:65165:71"/> 
                        <hi>have differ'd from another in glory;</hi> and laying great ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities upon ſome, and not on others, as greatly deſerving of them; and that in this time of <hi>general patience.</hi> If it were not thus, no reaſon could be given why ſo great Tracts of <hi>Humane Nature</hi> lye in the <hi>valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> having no <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>True Religion</hi> to <hi>ſhine</hi> upon them; And why without the great diſcompoſure and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the world, and without the ruin and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe that make the offers, there can be no offers of better made to them.</p>
                     <p>If it were not thus, no reaſon could be given why there is ſo great a corruption, even of Chriſtianity it ſelf, where it is generally profeſt; and the attempts of Reformation in Chriſtianity, are every whit as dangerous, or more than the perſuaſions to it addreſt to <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans;</hi> the lingring Acts of Cruelty in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> and horrible bloodineſs of <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> exceeding any thing of any other kind.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Lastly,</hi> If it were not thus, thoſe ſmaller Differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Proteſtants themſelves, who have had opportunity to look over the unreaſonableneſs and prodigious Inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <hi>Pagans, Turks, Jews,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in their perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, could never have brought forth ſo much of ſpleen, hate, and ſufficient proportions of the ſame cruelty among themſelves, when they have had before their eyes, not only thoſe pregnant motives to deteſtation of ſuch Barbarity, in thoſe forenamed examples, but that mirrour of patience, meekneſs, forbearance, <hi>The Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is it unworthy of good obſervation to this purpoſe, that the proceedings againſt offenders in the Laws of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion,</hi> or <hi>Morality,</hi> are generally with leiſure, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, proportion between the offence and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a compaſſion of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> even where ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is of greateſt neceſſity.</p>
                     <p>But in what men levy againſt different Religions, all is carried in ſtorms and whirlwind, in fury and rage, in blood,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65165:71"/> ſmoke and fire; arguing to us, That the Cauſe not fairly lying before <hi>Humane Juſtice,</hi> there being an error in the very foundation of the procedure, the evil increaſes, and grows upon mens hands, till it becomes too mighty for any Government, and ſo carries all before it into prodigious violence of Ferity and ſalvageneſs. And alſo, that Divine Juſtice therein ſhewing to man his great degeneracy, and liableneſs to Divine ſeverity, as God himſelf pleaſes, ſuffers the power of that <hi>Degraded Spirit, the God of this World,</hi> to triumph in nothing more than the abuſing <hi>Religion,</hi> and eſpecially <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that great Contrivance of Heaven, for mans recovery out of the ſtate of Devils; and to make it like an Engine of deſtruction to recoil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man himſelf, and fly every way with terrible death and ruin, as if <hi>Hell</hi> rather than <hi>Heaven</hi> came along with it.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding all this, it is moſt certain this whole miſery is conceiv'd and brought forth by the ſin and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of man to himſelf, by his own ſtupidity and folly, or by his <hi>wiſdom,</hi> that is worſe than <hi>folly, earthly, ſenſual, and Deviliſh;</hi> for the interpoſal of the Mediator runs ſo through the whole ſtate of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> that there are ſure ground-works laid how men might in every caſe recover happineſs, even out of miſery and degeneracy; and principally in this very Cardinal Point of that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>True Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> of it, care is taken how the World might be ſecured if it would, both from the Ambitious and unquiet man in his deſigns; how Government, Anthority, Soveraignty, might be kept ſafe; and yet unbeſmear'd too with <hi>Martyrs Blood;</hi> yea, even the blood of thoſe, who, though they are miſtaken, yet are willing to profuſe it for their Religion: For whom it ſhould move pity, the nearneſs of their caſe to the <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Honeſty</hi> of dying for <hi>True Religion.</hi> I mean when plain Foundations of <hi>Natural Religion</hi> are not deſtroyed, for that caſe deſerves no more mercy than poyſoning Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65165:72"/> or ſetting on <hi>fire,</hi> if men could, <hi>the whole courſe of Nature.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to diſcover this path or way to univerſal peace in Religion, (which is like <hi>Wiſdoms), The Vulturs eye hath not</hi>

                        <hi>ſeen it, nor the Lions whelp trod it; Death and deſtruction ſay, It is not with them; and well they may, For it is the way of peace, which they have not known, though they may have heard the fame of it with their ears. It is the way found out and declared by him that made weights for the winds, and ballance for the clouds. It is the way of the fear of the Lord, the beginning of Wiſdom, and departing from evil, the true underſtanding:</hi> There lyes the peace of <hi>Natural Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is the way of Chriſtianity, ſeen and publiſht by <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Way, the Truth, and the Life:</hi> That's the peace of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is certainly the proper excellency of Chriſtian Religion, and its very intention to bring this way both as Natural and Chriſtian, to light; to lay the grounds of it, to give the Rules and Meaſures of it, to ſweeten mens tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers to the good nature of it. That every one in a clear and ſtill air, not darkned with Clouds full of Thunder, and terrible with the Lightning of dreadful Laws, and Bloody Executions, may ſee, may be wary in the choice of his conduct of himſelf, to his unchangeable ſtate; and may therefore have light, have room, have ſtill and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, in which he may <hi>weigh every thing, prove every thing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that which I have now declar'd, is a way moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Word of God, and that Reaſon which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects either all mankind, or all Chriſtians. This is the Contrivance of Chriſtianity's providing, <hi>That the Wolf and the Lamb may dwell together, that the Lion may lye down with the Kid, that the child may play on the hole of the Aſp; that there may be no hurting, or deſtroying in all Gods Holy Mountain.

                     </p>
                     <p>And to preſent them in their Rational Poſſibility is a Vindication of Divine Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, an Offerture to man to be happy: Nor will the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form be always <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topian,</hi> the days will come when it ſhall paſs into life, power, and effect.</p>
                     <p>Now whenever this ſhall be in its Glory, that Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy of mankind, that <hi>curſe that lyes upon the earth, that vail of the covering ſpread upon the face of all Nations, that ſevere indignation of God againſt Humane Nature ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>I have thus far made a <hi>Lamentation</hi> upon the General State of the World, in relation to Religion; which till ſome ſuch mighty Influence come down from Heaven (as I have intimated) upon it, is like to be <hi>for a Lamentation:</hi> For the <hi>dark places of the Earth will be full of the Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cruelty;</hi> and it is certain, the <hi>Habitations of Cruelty</hi> will be furniſhed with the <hi>Inſtruments of Cruelty.</hi> And therefore, <hi>Oh my Soul, come not into their ſecret, unto their Aſſembly my Honour be not thou united; for in their anger they ſlay and destroy; and in their ſelf-will they dig down walls.

                     <p> And in the firſt place, it calls us to the Review of the <hi>Excellent Chriſtian Religion;</hi> even as <hi>Natural Religion,</hi> all <hi>eſſence,</hi> all <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> trace it throughout all its Doctrine, Worſhip, Rules of Life, they are all by their very Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>plain to him that underſtandeth,</hi> and <hi>right to them that find knowledg;</hi> there is <hi>nothing froward nor perverſe in them;</hi> its bands of peace are not politick, or worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues; no <hi>Ceremonial Symboliſm,</hi> or <hi>Ritual Shibboleth,</hi> but <hi>ponderous Verities,</hi> and <hi>Divine Love.</hi>

Let me apply this Diſcourſe to the Comprimiſe of all Differences betwixt Proteſtants, and particularly in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chriſtian Nation; not defining any Controverſal Point, but urging to that end ſuch undoubted Principles, as I have inſiſted upon in this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That ſuppoſing a <hi>National Church</hi> cannot be made out to ſatisfaction, yet <hi>Christian Kingdoms</hi> are ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a point of <hi>Scripture-Prophecy,</hi> that it cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So far therefore as National Worſhip can be agreeable to a mans Conſcience, making inquiry and moſt curious ſearch into the Word of God, both as to his <hi>Duty,</hi> and to his <hi>Liberty</hi> alſo, and poſſible <hi>Freedom</hi> from <hi>Scruple;</hi> every Chriſtian is oblig'd to <hi>Glorifie God</hi> in the publick ſervices of him, and <hi>Confeſſion of the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt with his native Country.</hi> Suppoſe a man ſhould retire to particular private Congregations, to ſupply what he may find want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the National Conſtitution, to compleat all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65165:73"/> of Chriſtian Communion, and the advantages of it; yet ſtill he is bound to promote and encourage <hi>National Religion,</hi> ſo far as it extends, to avoid as much as is poſſible, all <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and profeſt ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it, by putting the <hi>faireſt Conſtruction,</hi> and the <hi>kindeſt hopes</hi> upon thoſe things that ſeem doubtful; and as little infringing the Authority of Laws, as may be conſiſtent with ſentiments of Conſcience, and a due enjoyment of that liberty God hath given men of judging for their own ſouls, as in his ſight; <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe things that are not Laws of Natural Religion, and ſo indiſputable; or thoſe <hi>Grand Points of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> in which a Chriſtian can have no allowance: in all things elſe a Chriſtian hath a <hi>liberty,</hi> but ſo, that he muſt not uſe that his <hi>liberty</hi> as a <hi>cloake of maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> but as the <hi>Servant of God, give due Honour to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>all.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would therefore propoſe theſe three Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to draw men to the greateſt Conjunction with <hi>National Religian,</hi> that can by any means be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd with <hi>good Conſcience towards God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Conſiderat.</hi> 1. That if we examine things by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there are many abatements from the ſuppoſeable evil of external Obſervances, of which we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make our utmoſt Advantages to ſo great a Good, as our <hi>Profeſſed Conjunction with National Religion,</hi> while ſubſtantially good, though the <hi>High Places, I</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1 Kings 15. 14.</note> mean things equivalent in our opinion be <hi>not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> as in the times of the Excellent <hi>Kings of Judah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt then, as fundamental to this caſe, I ſuppoſe theſe two things Equiponderating one another.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>The high Character of National, Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

                        <hi>in the Word of God,</hi> as I have proved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>The Errors ſuppos'd in ſuch a National Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now <hi>Reformation of National Constitutions</hi> in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are unconteſtably in the Supreme Power of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: what then ſhall we do till theſe ſuppos'd Errors of ſuch an account as the <hi>High Places,</hi> are remov'd? we muſt either not worſhip in conſent with our <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which ſeems as natural as with our <hi>Families,</hi> and much countenanc'd by the <hi>Scripture;</hi> or we muſt wait the ſeaſons of <hi>publick Reformation;</hi> in the mean time at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending <hi>publick Worſhip,</hi> and avoiding with all the Wiſdom and Prudence we can, the Dint of Errors in ſuch a Conſtitution, as we ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſeven thouſand in Iſrael</hi> did not in far greater Corruptions omit certainly all ſorts of publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (beſides the <hi>Temple-Worſhip at Jeruſalem)</hi> and yet bowed not their <hi>knee to Baal,</hi> nor <hi>kiſſed him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Groſs Corruptions are indeed poſitively to be refuſed and abhorred, ſuch as thoſe of that time, ſuch as thoſe of Popery, ſuch as are (all, though not <hi>complete Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery)</hi> yet too near it; leſſer Diſſatisfactions may be waryly avoided, and yet <hi>National Religion,</hi> as far own'd as we can without ſharing even in thoſe ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Errors.</p>
                     <p>And it is ſome relief to us herein, that allthough it is evident National Laws cannot bind any mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in Religion, any further than they agree in the ſenſe of that mans Conſcience with the Word of God; for they cannot ſave him harmleſs at the laſt Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and therefore in no Reaſon can bind him; yet I ſay it is a relief in that Obedience a ſober Chriſtian deſires to pay to Humane Laws, (ſo far as agrees with Scripture) and the regards he would yield to National
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65165:74"/> Religion, that he may well take the Benefit of any Connivence or Relaxation of Humane Laws, in their proſecution; as all men how Conſcientious ſoever concerning <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> do (we ſee every day) where the Law is not preſſing, nor the injury any, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be no other but ordinary common liberty that is reſtrained; for if Authority be not deſpiſed, if publick Good be not incommoded, <hi>Humane Laws</hi> do not <hi>bind the Conſcience</hi> as <hi>Divine Laws do,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much leſs in Religion, wherein (except Natural) their Power hath not a further obligation, than as the Conſcience is ſenſible of <hi>Divine Authority</hi> concurring: Thus then a man may without offence withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſuch obſervances, and yet joyn in <hi>publick Worſhip.</hi>
                     </p>

                  <p>For ſeeing according to a grand Rule in Gods Adminiſtration of the World, Nations that have no National Religion, and whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalneſs therefore becomes <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> and is ſo branded by the Spirit of God, (for ſo Nations in Scripture very often ſignifies <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> that is, Nations without true Religion), are lyable to the <hi>pouring out of the wrath and fury of God</hi> upon them: It does not only follow by the rule of Contraries, that National true Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or Worſhip of the true God, hath a ſtrong order to, and connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the favour of God; but as the poſitive Propoſition is the prime and original, and gives ground to, and contains within it ſelf the privative; ſo does this Propoſition, That Gods <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> is at all times ready againſt thoſe that do <hi>not know him,</hi> that do not <hi>call upon him</hi> as join'd in a <hi>National Body,</hi> or <hi>Society,</hi> being the

                  <p>At the preſent, it will be enough to obſerve, that theſe two Holy men, the <hi>Compoſer of this Pſalm,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> (except as ſome think they were both one), deſiring the deſtruction of thoſe Heathen enemies under whoſe oppreſſion their own people (which at that time comprehended the Church of God) then groan'd, and praying <hi>in ſpirit</hi> for it, relye and reſt the whole weight of their prayer upon this principle of great truth and conſequence in Gods Government of the World, that as <hi>Families,</hi> as <hi>Nations,</hi> as <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> (for ſo all Communities are comprehended) they did not <hi>know</hi> nor <hi>call</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> that is, they did not worſhip the <hi>true God;</hi> and therefore were moſt juſtly ſubject to his fierceſt diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, it is couched under this, though indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, That the people that do know and call upon the true God, have a title to his ſavour, and vindication of them in all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, while they are conſider'd as ſo <hi>knowing,</hi> and calling upon him, and not contradicting it by their actions.

                  <p>And ſeeing the favour of God is Eternal Life, and his wrath burns to the loweſt Hell; both his wrath and his favour are to be underſtood in their extent even to everlaſting ages.</p>
                  <p>All which will ground the Propoſition, which I mainly intend in this Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That National true Religion is the greateſt ſecurity, ſtrength and defence of a Nation againſt the Divine wrath and diſpleaſure, and gives the ſureſt claim to his favour, bleſſing and protection, both in this world, and in that which is to come.</hi> Becauſe it is an obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the greateſt duty; and therefore to be moſt cloſely united in, and purſued to the utmoſt by all wiſe Nations, and by all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, and members of a Nation; for it is their firſt and higheſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 33. i2 &amp; 144. 15.</note> Intereſt: <hi>Bleſſed is the N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tion that is in ſuch a caſe, yea happy is the people whoſe God is the Lord, who have Jehovah</hi> thus <hi>for their God,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this very conſideration ſhould reconcile all differences in National Religion, that can be compoſed without loſs of that Truth, and corruption of thoſe parts of the Worſhip of God, which give denomination to true National Religion.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould incline thoſe that are above, to the greateſt conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſions, and thoſe that are beneath to the moſt free compliances
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:79"/> poſſible, if they value Religion, and love their Nation, that at leaſt there may be union in National Religion, if there cannot be perfect Uniformity. For I am fully perſwaded, that upon a ſtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Point, it will be found that National Religion (ſuppoſing it always the true) is the happieſt model of union in Religion of any upon earth, and moſt pleaſing to God, except that of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> whoſe union is in the Subſtantials of Truth, worſhip and practiſe, but comes under no other form or model properly taken: but except this, there is none ſo perfect to the ends and glory of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſo adaequate to the expreſſions of Scripture concerning the publickneſs of Religion, ſo encouraging and advantageous to the practiſe, ſo reconcileable with the peace of Religion and Nations, ſo preventive of the endleſs diviſions, and ſubdiviſions Humane Nature is apt to fall into, when it yields up it ſelf to a ſcrupuloſity, and Diſputatiouſneſs about Externals and Forms in Religion.</p>
                  <p>I ſay again, I am perſwaded no man can ſerve God with greater acceptableneſs, nor be Religious to greater ends and purpoſes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than by joining with the Nation, or Supream Civil Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whereof he is a member, ſo far as he can be permitted to do it, conſiſtent with the Truth of Religion, and Divine Worſhip. I ſay, as far as he can upon theſe accounts, if not throughout.</p>
                  <p>And of this I ſhall endeavour to give great and valuable proofs from Scripture, and Reaſon agreeable to it, and deduced from it; and herein being a <hi>Miniſter of God</hi> according to the <hi>National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>I magnifie my Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe I will firſt conſider of the Radical obligation we have to join our ſelves with others in the profeſſion of Religion, and Worſhip of God, and how it riſes from Perſonal Religion, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum</hi> or foundation of all; and by what degrees it muſt and ought to riſe, and how it moſt rationally determines it ſelf in National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It ought to attempt thus high, and cannot ſucceſsfully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt higher in the way of Aſſociation; to ſpread thus far, and cannot expatiate to any purpoſe beyond it: I ſhall therefore here give ſuch Arguments for <hi>National Religion</hi> out of Scripture, as it does not afford to any other figure of union in it.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place therefore it neceſſarily muſt be ſuppos'd and granted, That Perſonal Religion is the Fundamental Religion; even as a Nation, or even Univerſality of Humane Nature muſt become a notion without particular perſons, in whom all Communities ſubſiſt; even ſo muſt <hi>National,</hi> or <hi>Catholick Religion</hi> vaniſh into imagination,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65165:80"/> if it were not ſuſtained by particular and Perſonal piety; <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Families calling upon God,</hi> moſt neceſſarily imply and include the particular perſons of each doing ſo.</p>
                  <p>And herein it is further conſiderable, that every man is a compleat Being within himſelf; that as it is ſaid of him, He is in his Soul and Body a little World within himſelf, ſo he is a Kingdom, a Society within himſelf; and we may ſay in this ſenſe, He is a Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf alſo, as <hi>Solomon</hi> calling himſelf <hi>Coheleth,</hi> the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.</note> or the <hi>Preaching ſoul,</hi> in that great Treaty with himſelf, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his ſoul a Congregation, and a Preacher within and to it ſelf firſt, and then to the publick; ſo ought every man to be to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore is the firſt inviolable duty and obligation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, becauſe a man can never be abſent from himſelf; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for any force to ſurprize the paſſages of a ſoul to Heaven, or to hinder the ſouls Congregating in Holy Meditations, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes within it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And as a man is thus conſider'd, he cannot nor ought to ſuffer himſelf to be impos'd upon, or commanded without Divine Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; for as thus conſider'd, he cannot be forced by any, and he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4, 12.</note> countable only to God: <hi>He ſtands or falls to his own Maſter: Every one ſhall give account of himſelf to God;</hi> which is one of the greateſt Arguments the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſiſts upon for mutual forbearance in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things in Religion; every man on this account ought to be <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 15</note> able to <hi>render a reaſon of the hope that is in him,</hi> to himſelf and others; and not to reſt in an <hi>implicite faith.</hi> It will be no mans excuſe he was led or commanded into a falſe Faith, or Idolatrous worſhip.</p>
                  <p>Every man alſo upon this ſame account is bound <hi>to make confeſſion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>with his mouth to ſalvation</hi> in his proper place and ſtation; and in a narrower ſenſe, yet a ſenſe as large as his capacity and rank, every true Chriſtian is a <hi>Pillar, and Ground of Truth;</hi> that is, Truth muſt <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 15.</note> be ſetled, and ſtrongly ſeated in his ſoul, and he muſt expoſe Truth, and bear it out in Confeſſion and holy practiſe, and is himſelf a Temple or Houſe of the living God, where God will pleaſe to walk and dwell; and therefore can be no way obliged to join with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or any ſort of larger Community in a falſe Religion, though he ſhould ſtand alone in the true, or ſhould, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> forſake his <hi>People,</hi> or <hi>his Fathers Houſe</hi> to do it.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, <hi>It is not good for a man to be alone,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 12. 1. Gen. 2. 18.</note> though in true Religion, if it can be otherwiſe; he is made for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65165:80"/> Society and is, as it were, imperfect without it: Herein he reſembles God in ſome low degree, in whoſe <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>likeneſs</hi> he is made. God is an infinitely perfect Being in himſelf, yet he hath pleaſed himſelf in communicativeneſs to all his Creatures, and in the attraction of all in their ſeveral kinds, eſpecially <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to himſelf; as if he was not ſatisfied in being holy, in being happy alone.</p>
                  <p>Thus man, though if he could not have ſociety in True Religion, he would be yet a complete and abſolute Figure alone; yet where, and ſo far as he can have ſociety in it, he is ſo far from being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete alone, that he muſt needs prove a Cypher, a Nothing, if he affected and coveted to be alone: Whatever he has, if he has not <hi>Love,</hi> he is <hi>nothing; God is Love,</hi> and therefore rejoyces in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from himſelf and with himſelf, and ſo muſt, ſo does every good man, every holy man alſo.</p>
                  <p>If there be True Perſonal Religion, there muſt be Religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, for Man is made for Society; and if he meets, he muſt meet with that Religjous Senſe he has upon himſelf, with that I ſay he muſt meet with others, which ſeems the abſolute neceſſity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Society. For if a man meets with his own Religion others that have the ſame ſenſe of Religion, there ariſes a neceſſity of the Religion of all to meet together.</p>
                  <p>But further, Man was made for Society, and the firſt and ſupreme end of ſociety, as of all things, is the glory of God; and therefore ſociety is in the firſt place bound to be Religious ſociety. Marriage the Root and beginning of ſociety, was, that there might be <hi>a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeed, Mal.</hi> 2. 15. to ſuſtain a Succeſſion of Religion: So ſociety ſpreads on ſtill, that there might be Religious Societies.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon therefore as <hi>Seth,</hi> the firſt Deſcendent from <hi>Adam</hi> in the holy Line, had a Son born in the ſame Line, it is recorded, that <hi>Then Men began to call upon the Name of</hi> Jehovah, that is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Seth</hi> took it as a juſt and neceſſary occaſion, not <note place="margin">Gen. 4. ult.</note> only to ſet up a pillar of Thankfulneſs in ſeeing themſelves the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors of the <hi>bleſſed Seed,</hi> but in the foreſight of a holy ſociety, juſt ready to ſpring from their loyns, they thought fit to promote Divine Worſhip into a publick State and certain Order; and this I think the moſt agreeable Interpretation of that controverted place: ſo that from the beginning of the world, all along the Hiſtory of True Religion in the Old and New Teſtament, we ſhall find Religion contended into publickneſs, and all the advantages of Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65165:81"/>
                  <p> Yea Humane Nature hath taken this ſo for granted, that it is doubtful whether there ever was a ſociety in the world, politically united or not wholly barbarous, but it was cemented in Religion, though being ſo generally but falſe Religion, it proved no better than Heatheniſm.</p>
                  <p>There may have been private Cabals of Atheiſm, but there never was a publick Aſſociation againſt <hi>A God known and believed,</hi> except in Hell. If we could ſuppoſe a Society deſignedly united without Religion, it would be like the Plot for building of <hi>Babel,</hi> an endeavour of ſuch a part of mankind to ſet up for its ſelf and its own ſecurity, as it were in defyance of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>A Society united in Civils, and crumbled into Sects and Diviſions in Religion, that is, in the main ſubſtantials of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Practice, is a <hi>Babel,</hi> as it was under the curſe of Confuſion, of divided Language; A diſparagement of Religion, which can be as it is indeed Religion, but one; as if its <hi>Name</hi> were <hi>Legion,</hi> or as if in fundamental points it could not ſufficiently evidence it ſelf, ſo as to be known to be the true: Laſtly a diſanulling the ancient Law of Society, which is principally for the Union of Religion; ſo that if men could agree in all things elſe, and were yet divided here, it were not true humane ſociety, but would want the very nobleſt part or Principle of it, Religion, which is as a ſoul or ſpirit to it.</p>
                  <p>Yet too rigorous and ſevere a conſtraint of Uniformity, is both to forget humane infirmity, that does not allow ſo perfect an union in this world, (if a rigid Uniformity be indeed perfection) and to forget alſo that every man is a complete Being within himſelf, and makes a perfect Figure as he is alone; and therefore to grant nothing to this conſideration, is rather to crowd men into a <hi>Little eaſe</hi> in Religion, than to unite them; and ſo preſſing them too ſtrait, makes them fly out of that uneaſie ſtate for more room, and diſſolves the union that might elſe have been.</p>
                  <p>But in all the principal points of True Religion, Union is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that it ſtands good; <hi>Humane ſociety is for the ſake of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> yet in this ſtate of Gods patience to the world, Commerce, and civil Converſation are no more than Property founded in Grace, for then we muſt <hi>go out of the world,</hi> yet ſtill the ſupreme and prime end of Society is Religion.</p>
                  <p>Society in Divine Adorations is the ſtate of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven: It was deſigned to be the State of Innocency in this world. It is a Law that cannot be repealed; It is the perpetual Duty of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65165:81"/> Man: Fallen Nature hath a violent inclination to it, ſo that all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietyes conſent to <hi>walk in the name of ſome God,</hi> though miſtaken in the right object. But the word of God and Chriſtianity, as they moſt clearly reveal the True Religion ſo the neceſſity of Union in it.</p>
                  <p>The publickneſs of Religion therefore, that it is moſt chooſable for the glory of it to God, for the good it does to the ſouls of men, for the bleſſing and acceptance it receives from God; I ſhall plainly make evident from the reaſon of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Glory publick Religion preſents to God, it is evident, although God in his Son and Spirit is a ſufficient Spectator and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of, and infinitely rich in his own Glory, in the underſtanding of, and his own eternal praiſes of himſelf, ſo that nothing can be added to him; yet it is moſt evident, God is pleaſed to delight in the publickneſs of his ſervice, and the neareſt approach of all his Creatures to him, and that not in ſolitary ſervice, but the moſt conjoyn'd, as if infinity received Additions of Glory from the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and publickneſs of his Worſhip, which yet we know is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. But it is the abyſs of his goodneſs, that he delights in loving all his creatures, and being univerſally known, loved, and ſerved by them, and that in the greateſt Union herein, that as he himſelf is the prime Unity and Univerſality, and this is the perfection of his Being; ſo his Creatures ſprung from him may return to him in the ſame Univerſality and Unity, in reſemblance of himſelf, which is the higheſt and trueſt worſhip of him.</p>
                  <p>In Heaven there is an <hi>Innumerable company of Angels,</hi> and <hi>bleſſed Spirits, in one general Aſſembly,</hi> to praiſe and worſhip God. The Scripture excites the praiſe of <hi>all the Earth, of all the world, of all Lands, of all People, Tongues, Languages, Nations, Kindred and Families;</hi> even the <hi>Heaven, and Earth, and things under the Earth, and the whole hoſt of them,</hi> are called in to concert the Glory of God, and nothing left out <hi>but Death and Deſtruction,</hi> which <hi>cannot praiſe him,</hi> becauſe never made by him: And when the Glory of God, as it riſes from his Creatures, is repreſented at its higheſt pitch, it is thus ſet out: <hi>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many Angels round about the Throne, and the Beaſts, and the Elders, and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands, ſaying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb, &amp;c. And every Creature which is in Heaven, and on the Earth, and under the Earth, and ſuch as are in the Sea, and all that are in them I heard, ſaying, as it were in one Quire: Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory,</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:65165:82"/> 
                     <hi>and power be unto him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> alſo muſters up the whole Creation to join in the praiſes of God, not to fill up and adorn the <hi>Divine Poeſie,</hi> but to ſhew the indiſputable right God hath to the ſervices of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that in thoſe which are not able to pay it immediately by themſelves, every <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>prudent holy man</hi> is to obſerve that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of praiſe that is as it were marked upon them by the wiſdom that made them, and to offer it up for them, when the ſervice of God is repreſented, as moſt glorious in its being moſt publick.</p>
                  <p>Every thing therefore in Gods Ordination of Religion, tends to publickneſs; <hi>Our Saviour</hi> will not appear but in the <hi>fulneſs of his Body,</hi> the Church, which does as it were compleat him: For it is in this ſenſe his <hi>Complement</hi> or <hi>Fulneſs,</hi> though he fills <hi>all in all.</hi> The knowledg of God would cover the earth <hi>even as water does the Sea,</hi> and is reſtleſs, till it does; ſo the Preaching of the Goſpel is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>all Nations, to every creature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Prayer there is to be a coming of all fleſh to God. Praiſe is to riſe up as one pillar of Incenſe from the whole world. The Church eſpecially is to publiſh the name of the Lord, and to aſcribe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to our God.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſenſe of this is, that ſince God hath been pleaſed to place his Glory in the publickneſs of Religion, in this Univerſality of it, all good men are zealous and earneſt to draw in the publick Societies of the world, as much as they can, to love, fear, ſerve, pray to God, and praiſe him together.</p>
                  <p>God does not allow his ſervants that out of choice they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to the Religion of a Cloyſter, or a Wilderneſs, or a private ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated Aſſembly, as the greateſt honour to him, but delights in the moſt publick Aſſemblies of his Saints, ſervants, and creatures; for though the reaſons here of lye deep in the Divine Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet it is ſpoken to us in the plaineſt Language, as if God carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, as Princes do in their magnificence, whoſe Glory is in their great Courts, in the multitude of their Attendants, and People, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, Admirers, and Tributaries to their luſter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I argue to the publickneſs of Religion from the good it does to the ſouls of men. It is from hence the greateſt wiſdom <hi>to win ſouls;</hi> and they <hi>that turn many to righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the ſtars.</hi> Now the offer of true Religion to them that had it not before, the perſwaſion of it upon thoſe that have not yet obeyed it, tends to their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65165:82"/> Converſion, Repentance, to their love and fear of God. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that have the true ſenſe of theſe things in their own ſouls uſe all means out of love to the Glory of God, and to the ſouls of men to propagate them to others, which is beſt done by all publick acts of Religion: This is the original Law, from the very beginning it was ſo: <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam prophecyed</hi> publickly, <hi>The Lord cometh with ten thouſands of his Saints. Noah was a Preacher of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This was the great zeal of Chriſtians in the firſt times.</p>
                  <p>Further, It ſtrengthens, confirms, and inflames Religion among thoſe that are the joynt Profeſſors: Publick Religion is the great glory and ſecurity of Religion it ſelf, mutually warming and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in all its ſeveral parts, and the Profeſſors of it. <hi>As Iron ſharpens Iron, ſo is the countenance of a man to his Friend herein.</hi> How much more lively is Religion probable to be in a Religious, than an Atheiſtick and Barbarous Country? nor does God afford thoſe divine heats to thoſe that withdraw from Aſſemblies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, except in caſes of neceſſity, however he may ſupply in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary exigences, without which, <hi>Wo to him that is alone in Religion, if he fall he has not any to help him up: and how can one be warm alone? If one prevails againſt him, he wants a Second to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand together with him, and the benefit of the threefold cord, that is not eaſily broken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every thing in nature endeavours towards Community or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Unity, as its own ſtrength and ſecurity. Even the <hi>Devils</hi> retain ſo much of firſt Nature, as to knit in a community; and falſe Chriſtianity imitates the true in a pretence to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> though a moſt deſtructive one, like that of <hi>the God of this World,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires to Univerſal Monarchy, but it is in ſin and death.</p>
                  <p>But this does not diſparage True Religion, moving to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of Truth, Peace, and Life for evermore.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The bleſſing and acceptance that Religion receives from the Divine Majeſty, is much greater for the publickneſs of it; even in this ſence, <hi>Two are better than one, for they have a good reward for their labour.</hi> In thss ſence their complicated ſervices are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, <hi>their threefold Cord is not eaſily broken.</hi> Not that God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to any change in himſelf or his Government by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of his Creatures, though in a multitude; but he is pleaſed to found the occaſions and opportunities of his own moſt bountiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences, in the drawing near of their greater numbers: For as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65165:83"/> when God was pleaſed to communicate himſelf more freely, he did it to a multitude of Creatures; ſo he delights in receiving back the glory of having thus communicated himſelf from a multitude alſo; and as there is more of himſelf in more of his Creatures, whether of ſeveral ſorts or of the ſame, ſo there is more of his bleſſing in their approaches to him.</p>
                  <p>He that does not only <hi>weigh the Mountains in ſcales, but compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the duſt of the earth in a meaſure,</hi> takes notice of thoſe prayers and deſires of the <hi>poor of the people,</hi> that make the crowd and throng in his worſhip and ſervice: He accepts the pair of <hi>Turtle Doves,</hi> the <hi>two Mites,</hi> when it is <hi>the All,</hi> and is ready to reward it.</p>
                  <p>This was the policy of <hi>Nineveh</hi>'s Natural Religion, to unite their Force in Humiliation, Faſting, and Prayer, and to take advantage of joyning the mute deſires of the Beaſts, that have a voice in the ears of God: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant made the <hi>Camels kneel down</hi> while he prayed to God.</p>
                  <p>Thus in Thankſgivings, It was <hi>David</hi>'s art to gather up all the praiſes, even of the loweſt of the Creatures, that could ſo meanly give them, and inſpiring them with his own reaſon, made them, as it were, to follow his Harp, and unite in his own <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> Thus he ſerved himſelf of them, that making by them a greater preſent of glory to God, he might receive the greater bleſſing from him.

                  <p>Now all theſe expreſſions, reporting to us a great force in the publickneſs of Religious Duties, we know it is only from the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this publickneſs with the Divine Will and Nature, and his holy Ordination, who loves his <hi>Saints,</hi> and knows their approach to him is an approach to their life and happineſs: And becauſe he <hi>loves all his Saints and Creatures</hi> the more of them in conjunction draw near to him, the more of his <hi>tender mercies</hi> have the occaſion to ſpread themſelves; <hi>for elſe all the Nations are to God, but as the drop of the Bucket, and the duſt of the Ballance; all their ſervices are not ſufficient to him for a ſacrifice to burn before him: He humbles himſelf to behold the things that are in Heaven, as well as thoſe on Earth.</hi> He with great delight yet looks to one <hi>that is of a broken and contrite ſpirit, and that trembles at his word. As one day and a thouſand years are both alike to the Infinity of God, ſo are a thouſand perſons and but one;</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65165:83"/> 
                     <hi>as it is all one to him to ſave with many or few,</hi> ſo it is to be intreated by them in prayer, or accept their praiſe; but according to the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and holineſs of the Divine Manifeſtation in his Love and Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo he is pleaſed to ſee his Servants draw near to him in an union of Love among themſelves, and every one having a claim to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, who is all Goodneſs, the united claim is ſtronger. <hi>He hears even the Ravens that cry,</hi> for they are his Creatures; if any man therefore could intwiſt their cry with his own in a general ſcarcity, he makes his own ſo much the ſtronger. He then that joyns the prayers and deſires of many with his own, doubles ſtill the ſtrength, as is manifeſt by the Apoſtles ſo often and earneſtly deſiring the help of prayers.</p>
                  <p>And this may anſwer what may ſeem to be an objection againſt good men joyning with publick and promiſcuous Aſſemblies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are ſo many ignorant and bad men, that by their ſins, ignorance, and folly, rather obſtruct the effect and acceptance of good men joyning with them; ſo that it may ſeem better if holy and good men ſeparated themſelves, and left the generality of a Nation out of their Religious Services.</p>
                  <p>But from what hath been ſaid it is very plain, that as the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Steward</hi> ſerved themſelves of the Beaſts in their prayers, and <hi>David</hi> ſerved himſelf of the very loweſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in his praiſes, ſo good men conſecrating the <hi>publick Religion,</hi> though reſulting from a medley of worſe men, turn it to greater glory to God, advantage to themſelves, and the advantages of thoſe worſer men alſo, in ſundry reſpects, when it does not prevail to their converſion and eternal ſalvation; as figures of value ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating to themſelves Cyphers, increaſe Sums to very vaſt.</p>
                  <p>The ſervices of men not truly Religious, are not ſo acceptable to God alone, but are ennobled by the union of truly good men; for that they have ſuch a vertue is plain; even <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, though good men themſelves, received good by his offering their ſacrifices; and that good men may ſubject the ſervices of evil men to their own, is as plain by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> rejoycing, that <hi>Chriſt was preached by thoſe that preached him out of envy and contention, for while his preaching Chriſt out of love,</hi> over ruled theirs, who <hi>preached the ſame Chriſt</hi> from worſer reſpects; all their preaching of Chriſt was ſo forcibly united with the Apoſtles, that it became as if it was wholly his own, &amp; <hi>turned to his Salvation;</hi> the greater &amp; truer Light drinking up the leſs, &amp; the leſs noble which followed in attendance upon it; &amp; ſo much more the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65165:84"/> prayers of leſs worthy men are ſnatched up to Heaven with the prayers of Holy men, and prevail for a full acceptance of them with God, leaving only ſome leſſer portions of Bleſſing to thoſe whoſe Hearts do not aſcend with their prayers: Yet we muſt be careful of ſaying to any, <hi>Stand off, I am holier than thou.</hi> Many a man being rejected under the Appearance of a <hi>Publican,</hi> whoſe heart's breaking within it ſelf to God has greater acceptance from him, than what ſeems rather to be preferr'd among men.</p>
                  <p>For the Honour therefore of the moſt publick Conjunction in Holy Services, we may obſerve, thoſe men who are of the moſt Happy memory in Scripture, Men of Renown for the Efficacy of their prayers, as <hi>Noah, Moſes, Samuel Job, Daniel,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and many others, were no Monkiſh ſort of men; No men of Separation from the publique upon choice, but Perſonages, as of the moſt Divine ſpreading Reaſon, ſo of a publique Wiſdom, Grace, and Spirit, containing a publique Intereſt, and Piety within their own Breaſts; yet joyning with as many as they could, to better their ſervices mutually, and not ſcrupling union with them, leſt they ſhould be made worſe, or their ſervices leſs acceptable; Men of no narrow and contracted Spirits, Principles or Devotion, but like our Saviours converſe with <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> they were as <hi>Phyſicians to the ſick, Helps to the weak,</hi> as well as the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parions of all that fear God, pulling ſinners with violence out of the Fire, converting them from the error of their way, ſaving ſouls from Death, and endeavouring to hide the multitude of ſins;</hi> and therefore were ſo prevalent in prayers for others, though at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God was ſo incens'd, as to deny Audience even to ſuch, except for their own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Thus clear it is on the ſide of Publique Religion in theſe great Examples; they ſeparated from the ſins, the ſuperſtitions, that were at any time become publique, but joyn'd with the Publique Religion, and thereby rais'd it to much higher Excellency: It is impoſſible to make bad Things good, as Falſe Worſhip, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Practiſe, if never ſo many Good men fell into them; It would endanger them, but cannot better that, which is of it ſelf bad: But that which is in it ſelf Good, which would be much diſpirited through Evil handling it, by Bad men, may be made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by Holy mens Predominancy, and Aſcendency in it; and ſo turn to general Good, in <hi>ſome Thirty,</hi> in <hi>ſome Sixty,</hi> in <hi>ſome an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredfold;</hi> which ſhews the Nature of the both Communicativeneſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65165:84"/> and Singularity of theſe Holy men; Communicativeneſs in True Worſhip, though with Bad men; Singularity from Sin and Falſe Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>I have now diſpatched this firſt Head I propoſed concerning the publickneſs of Religion in general: I come now to the ſecond Head, <hi>That this publickneſs determines it ſelf in National Religion, neither ſtaying ſhort of it, nor expatiating beyond it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to make good this, I firſt conſider how humane Society riſes, and what are the firſt bands of Union. And it is very evident the firſt Aſſociations of mankind muſt grow out of Families, as I have obſerv'd the Law of Humane Society was firſt declar'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulg'd upon the Inſtitution of Marriage. This was the beginning of Families, Families of all greater aſſociations of men. Here alſo muſt begin all Religious Society. Theſe are the moſt near and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd; here therefore are the moſt frequent ſeaſons of worſhipping God, of daily praiſes of him, and prayers to him. The examples of it we find in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s, <hi>David</hi>'s, <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Families, and the Churches in the Houſes of ſome Chriſtians at the firſt. This Domeſtick Body is moſt cloſe with it ſelf, and more eaſily call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, therefore the firſt ſeat of Religious Society.</p>
                  <p>Families therefore for the cloſeneſs, nearneſs, and naturalneſs of that Government, as being the ſmalleſt of Communities, but the moſt primitive, are particularly nam'd in this Prayer againſt the Heathen, and made another expreſſion together with Kingdoms of Irreligious Communities.</p>
                  <p>For as Kingdoms are greater Families, united indeed as Families but greater.</p>
                  <p>So Families though leſſer, were yet the firſt Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Religion therefore being a moſt unconteſtable duty and obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe leſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r Kingdoms, Families, it argues to the ſame obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and duty in thoſe greater Families, Kingdoms, and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or Irreligion of the one and the other run along one with the other.</p>
                  <p>Thus God firſt eminently himſelf founded Religion in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and ſo commenc'd both the Family and Religion into a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Kingdom. Religion therefore riſes higher, and ſettles here as upon the moſt advantageous Eminences, as in the moſt full and free ſpread Communities, call'd Nations for their greatneſs and numerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Kingdoms for their Majeſtick government and union in it.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65165:85"/>
                  <p> For a Nation or Kingdom is a part of Mankind canton'd indeed from the whole world, and the wideneſs of that, yet into a larger compaſs than Neighbourhoods, Towns or Cities, and is generally incloſed within ſome more remarkable bounds of place, as Seas, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Mountains; united by nearneſs of Manners, Cuſtoms, and Diſpoſition, ariſing from like Temperature of Air and Climate, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Converſation and Commerce, having one and the ſame Language, but eſpecially as under the ſame Civil Intereſts, Laws, Government, and Legiſlative Authority.</p>
                  <p>For theſe mutual Bonds are they which give Reaſon to National Religion, as the moſt ſolemn inſtance of publick Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, becauſe by vertue of theſe it becomes one great Family.</p>
                  <p>I know there may be ſome exceptions from this deſcription of a Nation, which will have their force upon National Religion alſo as it reſults from it. For ſometimes one Monarchy does as it were ſtride over more Nations, ſometimes one City or Free Town is diſtinguiſht from the reſt of the World by one Government, one Civil Intereſt, independent in its Government in its proper Intereſt upon any other.</p>
                  <p>Now in ſuch a Monarchy as contains ſeveral People and Nations under it, it does not properly give name to a National Religion, while their Intereſts, Laws, Converſation, and Civil Commerce are preſerved and kept diſtinct, as theſe are often allowed to be under ſome conquering Potentacy.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide if a narrower compaſs of people than we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call a Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> a Region, a Province, a City, hath its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, its Laws, its Government, Converſation and Commerce, intire to it ſelf; it is as to the purpoſe we are now upon, as it were a Nation.</p>
                  <p>The ſum then is this: ſo far as Humane Society has drawn any People or Families into a cloſe and more compacted ſtate of Civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, neceſſitude one to another, and Government running up to the higheſt point of Government in that compact ſtate, ſo far is the obligation of Union in publick Religion drawn upon them; where theſe are freer, that attendance to union in Religion is freer alſo, any further than the common truth of Religion, and the obligations of that, bind even thoſe at greateſt diſtance and union one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
                  <p>For thus Religion may and ought to unite all the true Profeſſors of it, at what remove ſoever from one another. It may and ought
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65165:85"/> alſo to paſs upon whatever bond of union there is in the world; but there is no ſuch union as Laws, Commerce, Converſation, common ſafety running all up to the ſupreme Government over that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to graft Religion upon. All elſe is but conſent in the ſame unity of one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Faith, one Baptiſm, which make the Catholick Church one Body, and joining with one another, preſentially in the ſame acknowledgments of God, when a concurrence of all things neceſſary happens to fall out, as cannot be ſuppoſed frequent in parts remote one from another, and of a divers lip or language.</p>
                  <p>The Catholick Church is indeed united as Humane nature is, in one and the ſame true Reaſon, and thereupon a readineſs of wiſe and learned men to correſpond one with another at a diſtance, or confer one with another if at any time ſuitable concurrences favour it, or as the world, much more the Catholick Church is a Temple built to the Glory of the Creator and Redeemer, wherein all good men meet from one end of the Heaven to the other, in the unity of the ſame Spirit, and in the ſame kind of worſhip; and if opportunity allowed, in the ſame actual worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The nearer therefore any parts of the Catholick Church are by the Neighbourhood of Nations, by the frequency of Traffick, the neare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; the more frequent the correſpondencies are, the mutual aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, may and ought to be.</p>
                  <p>But now in the Dependencies and Interweavings of all Civil Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in Nations, there are not only thoſe voluntary and contingent correſpondencies, but ſuch as firſt grow out of the nature of Humane Society, and bind of themſelves to common true Religion; and then have the favour, encouragements, directions, obligations of Laws and Authority running like the ſame ſpirit into all the ſeveral parts of a Nation, and recommending that National true Religion as it ſtands in this Union that is firſt commanded by God, beſides much more free, ordinary, Actual Meetings in one and the very ſame place, and Acts of Worſhip. It is true indeed, the Worſhip of God allows our worldly callings, and the proviſions of the preſent life, and Relation, and therefore a Neighbourhood, whether it be the more populous of Cities, or Towns, or the more infrequent of Villages, hath the conveniencies of more ſolemn and ſtated Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the ordinary fit ſeaſons of the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> and other ſolemn times of worſhip: thereupon National Religion is generally exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in theſe leſſer Societies, even as the Juſtice and Execution of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65165:86"/> Laws; and National Authority, muſt be brought home to men in their particular Countries, and Towns, and not reſt in the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cities at a diſtance from their daily Buſineſs and Converſation; and yet the ſtandard of all things National is generally preſerv'd there for the very ſake of union. Even ſo of National Religion, not as Religion; for the ſtandard of that is Scripture only: but as National; ſo the Agreement in it is depoſited with all other National Acts. So that National Religion hath the advantage in theſe two things: Firſt, The Naturalneſs and Cloſeneſs of the Union of a Nation to all the Intereſts of Humane Society; and therein it imitates the nearneſs and cloſeneſs of Families, or leſſer Incorporations, as much as can be conſiſtent with the ſecond thing, <hi>viz</hi> The Illuſtriouſneſs, Magnificence, Honourableneſs of Religion, as ſeated in larger Bodies, but eſpecially as upon the Soveraignties and Supremacies of the Great Incorporations of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only obſerve further, That All this does moſt effectually exclude the pretence of an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church-Monarchy,</hi> as hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Religion, as an Univerſal State-Monarchy in Politicks, and Civil Liberty. Both of which are indeed Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>The Imaginary Benefits of ſuch ſorts of Union are infinitely toilſome, and tedious, while they are expected, and always in the iſſue found impoſſible to be enjoyed in their Fruits; but in the mean time, while the pretenders are labouring for, and graſping at ſo vaſt a power, they fill the world with the lamentable effects of their Ambition, and do indeed deſtroy Humane Society, becauſe thoſe Laws and Bands that tye it together, being ſo over-ſtrain'd, fly in pieces; and I am ſure nothing is more contrary to <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> than an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Head of Religion</hi> here upon Earth, except Chriſt himſelf with an Ubiquity of Holineſs, Power and Influence, came down to reign upon it. An univerſal Union were indeed deſirable, and glorious, if there were an Omnipreſence of Vertues anſwerable to the Adminiſtration; but that being too great for any creature; too great in the preſent ſtate of the World; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Chriſtian Religion glide along with the Civil Union they find prepared, as I ſhall preſently evince, beyond which is nothing but Uſurpation.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the Arguments from Scripture and Reaſon for National Religion, not afforded to any other Figure of Union in it.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:65165:86"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>The firſt Argument ſhall be,</hi> that I derive from this prayer, I <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> have choſen to diſcourſe this point upon: and I lay it thus. The prayers, in which <hi>Holy men ſpake, as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> reſt upon ſome great Pillars and Principles of Divine Truth, and Argument: For particular caſes, in which they prayed, are brought to thoſe general principles, by an underſtanding inlightned to underſtand, in an humble ſenſe, even as God underſtands, and inflam'd with a Holy Affection, in a lowly Imitation of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Zeal,</hi> wherewith God performs all his <hi>Holy Ordinations.</hi> Thus as <hi>Princes they have power with God,</hi> becauſe they offer him their Petitions according to his Eſtabliſhed Rules of Government, and his own <hi>Holy Will,</hi> concerning the things, wherein they pray to him.</p>
                  <p>Now the underſtanding theſe Rules was extraordinary, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and Servants of God inſpir'd by him, but to us in ordinary by the light of the Word of God, by the Laws of True and Right Reaſon in deductions from that word: And in which word, and the deductions from it, if we are not miſtaken, the Efficacy will be certain, becauſe if we <hi>ask according to his will, we are ſure he heareth us, and that we have in ſome true ſenſe the Petitions we ask of him.</hi> This is ſo valuable a Rule of prayer, that <hi>Daniel,</hi> though ſo great a <hi>Man of Viſion,</hi> yet betook himſelf to this ordinary means of Inſtruction in the mind of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. By Books of Holy Records, and general Chronology, he knew that the time of the <hi>Babyloniſh Captivity</hi> was near its Expiration, and ſo <hi>ſet himſelf to prayer,</hi> and was crown'd with this wonderful ſucceſs and acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Thus prayers prevail with God, and yet without any change in him, there being a Configuration, or Concurrence of all things, according to his own unchangable Will; His <hi>Counſels of old,</hi> that are Faithfulneſs and Truth, are remonſtrated to him by the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſervent deſires of his ſervants, that knew them to be his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and who are ordered by the ſame counſels to enquire, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him by prayer according to them, and therefore by his <hi>ſpirit, the ſpirit of prayer,</hi> He draws the parallel lines to his own Intentions upon their Hearts, Deſires, and Affections.</p>
                  <p>I have purſued this the further, becauſe it gives a ſolution to that Doubt, how God without any change in himſelf hears pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and alſo aſſures us, this prayer being ſo remarkable, as to be twice us'd in the ſame words, moſt certainly bears it ſelf upon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65165:87"/> ſome certain principle, from which we may argue to general practiſe. The principle it reſts upon, muſt be this: There is an Eſtabliſh'd order betwixt <hi>the wrath</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God; <hi>His Fury,</hi> and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> and <hi>the Nations,</hi> or <hi>Families, not knowing, not calling on his Name:</hi> and this is known by very light of Nature. <hi>His Wrath,</hi> according to unchangable Laws, is always <hi>prepar'd</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that forſake him, and that Duty they owe to him, as Nations: It had been elſe a great preſumption upon God, and Breach of Charity to the Nations ſo to pray againſt them; which may alſo give us account of all thoſe Dreadful Imprecations, and Curſes, <hi>David,</hi> and other <hi>Prophets</hi> and Holy men pour out againſt their own Enemies, and the Enemies of their people; They are founded in their being Enemies to God, his True Worſhip, Love, and Service, and as ſuch their Final Deſtruction was decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by the moſt Righteous Laws of Divine Government, made known unto thoſe Holy men, and ſo they prayed for it as publique perſons, and not out of private Wrath and Revenge: but this by the way. I proceed now in the main Argument.</p>
                  <p>And this principle I am upon, That the Wrath of God is againſt the <hi>Nations</hi> that are without <hi>National Religion,</hi> lyes deeper in a Firſt, and more Original principle, <hi>viz.</hi> There is an Obligation, a great Duty lying upon <hi>Nations,</hi> as <hi>Nations to know, and worſhip the True God;</hi> For elſe <hi>why ſhould God find fault? why ſhould he be angry, when none had reſiſted his Will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence it is, That there is a Natural Order eſtabliſhed by God, between his Love, and Favour, and a People, and their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique True Religion, becauſe it is the Obſervation of a Duty, and the Obſervation of Duty is the fitting us for Bleſſing, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>avour, as the neglect, and Tranſgreſſion of Duty cannot be without wrath and diſpleaſure. For thus God hath placed <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> one over againſt another; yet ſo that <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> are always firſt, even as Duty is always before ſin: For God <hi>never made Death and Deſtruction,</hi> even as he never could be the cauſe of ſin, but they come in by the Failing of our Duty, and ſo of that Life and Bleſſedneſs entail'd on our Duty.</p>
                  <p>Yet the Obligation to National True Religion is much more evident from theſe Holy men, praying down Wrath upon them that <hi>know not God,</hi> and that <hi>call not on his Name;</hi> then it could have been from the praying for his Favour to them, that <hi>did know him,</hi> and that did <hi>call on his Name;</hi> becauſe his Favour might
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65165:87"/> have been vouchſafed upon Terms much below our ſubſtantial and inviolable Duty: As many of the <hi>Jewiſh Rites</hi> might be Arguments for, and Pledges of Gods gracious Regard to the people, he had ſo diſtinguiſh'd, when the want of thoſe ſigns would not have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued to the effuſion of his Wrath and Vengeance, there being no natural, or poſitive Duty lying upon any, but the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances: There may be many Arguments for the Bounty and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God from External Rites appointed by him, and obſerv'd by his people; though indeed theſe all refer to their Eſſential Duty, and argue nothing without it: Yet the contrary will not enforce to the oppoſite Degrees of Wrath and Indignation, becauſe they are not obſerv'd, when no ſubſtantial Duty is violated. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that keeps the Law,</hi> may have in the main the ſame ſecurity from wrath, with <hi>Circumciſion that keeps the Law alſo.</hi> Seeing then there is ſo great wrath againſt thoſe <hi>that know not God, that call not on his Name;</hi> It aſſures us, the Duty, the Obligation, and the Reaſon of it lye deep, that the omiſſion is ſo ſubjected to the Divine Revenges: and it is in this; A ſociety without Religion is a High contempt of God, <hi>a making fleſh our arm,</hi> and departing from the Lord, and ſo from his Favour and Bleſſing. A princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality without an Inſcription, a Dedication to the Glory of God, to which all things are to be devoted, is like the building <hi>a Tower up to Heaven.</hi> A ſin like the ſin of <hi>Herod,</hi> when he let that Sacrilegious Applauſe ſink into him, and gave not <hi>the Glory to God,</hi> and therefore ſubjects men to be at any time ſmitten and blaſted by God; who has ſaid, <hi>Thoſe that honour him, he will honour; but all elſe ſhall be lightly eſteem'd,</hi> whether <hi>Nation</hi> or <hi>Perſon.</hi> It is not therefore only the Judgment upon the Irreligion of particular perſons, of particular Families, that is here intended, though this is included and ſuppos'd, but eſpecially upon the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Societies, knitting and ſtrengthning themſelves without the True God; upon Principalities exalting themſelves, and not by and with the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and <hi>Supreme Majeſty.</hi>

                  <p>On the other ſide, if there be a Duty, an Obligation of being publiquely Religious, there is a Bleſſing upon it, according to that Fundamental Principle; <hi>He that cometh to God, muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him: that Godlineſs hath the promiſes of this life, and of that which is to come:</hi> And this muſt be firſt, becauſe as Righteouſneſs and Duty are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin, ſo Bleſſing and Favour are before Wrath and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65165:88"/> Yet Wrath is a more certain Demonſtration of abſolute Duty violated, than Favour is of abſolute Duty obſerv'd, becauſe the Favour of God is more at liberty than his Wrath, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways depends on ſtrict Juſtice. All which amounts to the full proof of the great Duty of <hi>National Religion</hi> from this prayer, ſeeing National Irreligion is <hi>ſo near the Curſe of Divine Fury and Revenge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus far conſidered National Religion, as it is founded <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> in the very Laws of Nature, and inviolable duty to God. I come ſecondly, to conſider the Wiſdom, and unqueſtionable Rationality of the Divine Ordination <hi>among the Jews;</hi> when by a Prerogative of Power, and Goodneſs, God would ſecure the True Religion, after <hi>the Nations</hi> had ſo corrupted themſelves, and that he had now begun, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>to ſuffer them to walk after their own ways:</hi> He founds his Worſhip, as it were anew, firſt in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, and from thence commences it into a National State, even as he did the Family, wherein he had plac'd it, and that for the very ſake of his True Worſhip, which <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> had indeed many peculiars in its Religious Conſtitution, ſuch as are not to be found in any other, as I ſhall after account for them; yet in the general, it is an Evidence of the Fitneſs and Agreeableneſs of that Model of Humane Society, to the Ends of Religion, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptableneſs to God, it ſhould be ſo devoted.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we may think this chuſing of <hi>Abrahams Family,</hi> and the <hi>Nation</hi> riſing from it, was an Interdict upon any other <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or <hi>Nation,</hi> to inſtitute a publique National Religion, any other ways, than as they <hi>Proſelyted</hi> themſelves to that one Nation and Family: It is very obſervable, there are elſewhere the footſteps of <hi>National,</hi> and <hi>Family Religion,</hi> though more rare in that very time, as in <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who was <hi>King of Salem, of Peace and Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Prieſt of the moſt High God,</hi> ſo incorporating Religion with his Government, the ſame is to be found in <hi>Job,</hi> and his Friends: ſo that the Erecting a <hi>National Religion</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> did not ſuperſede the obligation of any of the <hi>Nations</hi> to the <hi>National Worſhip</hi> of God, though in Judgment paſt our finding out, He <hi>ſo overlook'd them, as to leave them to themſelves, for he never left himſelf without witneſs</hi> He ought to be ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, by <hi>giving them fruitful times and ſeaſons, and filling their hearts with food and gladneſs: He was never far from them, in</hi>

Beſides thoſe of the <hi>Nations</hi> that were near the <hi>Jews</hi> were allowed to unite themſelves to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> National Religion, when the Laws of Nature were grown ſo dark and obſolete among themſelves; and though they were the ſons of ſtrangers, yet God aſſur'd them a <hi>place in his ſanctuary;</hi> but becauſe there was not proviſion e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the multitude of the Nations within the Bounds of that Religion; it was certainly at all times lawful and pleaſing to God, that they ſhould have Nationally dedicated themſelves to the <hi>true Jekovah,</hi> though eminently known then to be the <hi>God of Iſrael:</hi> and that they did not ſo, gave reaſon always to his Wrath againſt them, whenever he pleaſed to execute it.</p>
                  <p>But I haſten to the third Argument of nearer concernment to us.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument I derive from the Favour of <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>3</label> to National Religion; of which I ſhall lay down ſeveral proofs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſtianity repeals none of the Laws of God that are founded in the very Nature of Things: if therefore National Religion be according to the Rules of Eſſential Duty towards God, if it be the <hi>Reaſonable ſervice</hi> of Nation; It is certain Chriſtianity does not remove it, but reſtores and exalts it to the greateſt perfection: <hi>Chriſt came not to diſſolve any of thoſe Laws,</hi> but to fulfil them, that is, to reſtore the Doctrine to its juſt Integrity, where it was falſly gloſs'd upon; and if any thing was wanting in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Revelation of it, to ſuperadd what might render it moſt complete.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of the ſame Nature is the ſecond proof, That if God not only for the ſake of type, and ſhadow, which was uſeful for that State of the Church, but for the ſake of the real Goodneſs and Uſefulneſs of the Thing it ſelf, pitch'd upon the National Form of Religion, by his immediate Revelation to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> (as I have already argued), it cannot be ſuppos'd to be revers'd by Chriſt: It remains therefore among thoſe things <hi>that are written for our Admonition, and Learning, on whom the Ends of the world are come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:65165:89"/> 3. Chriſtianity vouches it ſelf a Religion of the moſt publique ſpirit and intention, and came into the world by the High Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God to open all paſſages for Truth and Divine Knowledge among men; as innumerable places in the Old and New Teſtament aſſure us; ſo that the Goſpel moſt evidently deſigns it ſelf to be free, and publique, as the Heaven, as the lights of it, and the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> may well be apply'd to it: <hi>The line of it is gone throughout all the Earth, and its words to the ends of the world:</hi> ſo far therefore as Naturalneſs, and Publiqueneſs agree, ſo far the thing is undeniable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Many expreſſions of the <hi>Prophets</hi> that went before, of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> that fol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>owed after, have a particular Favour for National Religion. To name ſome of a multitude: <hi>Chriſt ſhall ſprinkle many Nations: He is the Deſire of all Nations: Go make Diſciples of all Nations: All the Kingdoms of the World ſhall become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>magnifies himſelf,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle of the Nations;</hi> He compares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>with the Holy Prieſthood,</hi> while by <hi>Preaching the Goſpel,</hi> he was negotiating in the <hi>offering up the Nations, a ſacrifice conſecrated,</hi> and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, the greateſt ſacrifice that was ever offer'd to God, except that of the <hi>Son of God, offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And this is the only inſtance of <hi>the Miniſtry of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> reſembled with the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> or cloath'd with that Denomination of Prieſtlineſs, uſe hath appropriated to it, and that to no other office but of Preaching to Converſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I know the proofs from theſe Scriptures are lyable to be retrench'd by expounding them of the Diffuſion of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity into the Catholick Church throughout the World, and then calling out of every Nation Converts into particular Societies and Congregations; I ſhall make an Eſſay to level the line of them to Nations and Kingdoms, as they are united into ſuch Conſpicuous, and Illuſtrious Bodies of Mankind, with their Principalities ſo form'd, ſo compacted, and not only a Diffus'd Catholick Church, or ſmall and inviſible Congregational Churches.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Kingdom of Chriſt can no way attain that Greatneſs, which it is prophecyed and foretold it ſhall attain, if it does not allow Nations, as Nations to aſſociate themſelves in the profeſſion of it; if it only gives Right to private and particular Churches, or Congregations; and a Diffuſive Church, that can no way congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, which though great in its Spiritual Union, yet ariſes to no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65165:89"/> viſible Greatneſs; but as it moving into all parts of the world, congregates it ſelf according to any of the Laws, or Advantages of Humane Society it falls into, and finds prepared for it: The <hi>Meſſiah</hi> then can never, as is prophecyed of him, <hi>have his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion divided him with the great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor divide the ſpoyl with the ſtrong,</hi> but muſt reſt in a very low and under-condition of ſmall, private, and particular Aſſemblies of his ſervants, profeſſing him; but a <hi>National Chriſtian Religion,</hi> a Religion, as Famous as the name of the moſt populous Cities, and the greateſt Princes and their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, in honour to the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> muſt not be allowed, no not according to his own Deſignation. For though the Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of the Doctrine, and the Appearance of God with it, does infinitely ſurmount all created Greatneſs; yet many places of Scripture compare the Honour and Glory of Chriſt, as a Prince over Nations, with other Soveraignties, and prefer his; not only in regard of the Heavenlineſs, and Eternity of it, but as it obtains an Intereſt and Command in the world. For it is a Government over Nations, as Nations; over the Laws and Principalities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and not of one only, but many Nations; not indeed in the way of Worldly power, but Divine perſwaſion: Evidences of Truth, and Reaſon, Vertue of Holineſs, and Goodneſs, are <hi>the Scepter of this Kingdom, the weapons of this Power;</hi> and this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhall grow greater, and greater, till all the Prophecies are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly fulfill'd in the Soveraignty of Chriſt, and the loweſt ſubjection of all Kingdoms to him: the greateſt <hi>Mountains</hi> diſappearing and becoming nothing before him, when <hi>the fulneſs of the Jews,</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> are come into him. Thus it is <hi>a Mountain ſet upon the top of the Mountains;</hi> not only in the Eminency of its Doctrine, but the profeſſed ſubjection of the Governments of the world (that are in Scripture call'd <hi>Mountains)</hi> to it, for his Truth, Meekneſs, and Righteouſneſs ſake: But if Nations receiving and flowing into Chriſtianity, ſink it preſently into particular, private Aſſemblies, as it was while under perſecution, and that it ſhould be of no more publique Honour, than at ſuch times; the <hi>Mountain of the Lords houſe</hi> ſhould not be above the Hills, but ſhaded by them, and that according to the very Conſtitution of Chriſtianity it ſelf; for the Supremacies ſtand aloft, but the profeſſion of Chriſt retires into privacies; yea the worſhip of the True God, <hi>Creator of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth,</hi> which after the appearance of the Son of God in the world, is only in Chriſt, muſt be ſo far from being <hi>exalted,</hi> as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65165:90"/> is everywhere ſignified, that it muſt be abated and brought low by the Depreſſion and falling down of <hi>the Moſaick Frame;</hi> for then it was ſetled upon one of the Principalities of the world; and though it be now more diffus'd, yet if it not only be not, but ought upon its own principles to be Eſtabliſhed in, and upon the publick profeſſion of a Nation; It has not, nor can have ſuch an Eminency as among the <hi>Jews,</hi> when it had the Awfulneſs and Majeſtickneſs of a Kingdom devoted to that true Worſhip, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it thereby of much greater notice in the World.</p>
                  <p>And if Religion may be National, even as Nations themſelves are united in a way of order, ſo muſt National Religion alſo be by order compos'd into its Nationalneſs: and this by the Rules of Scripture and Right Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But let this be no pretence to that Tyranny in Chriſtian Religion, that great Uſurpation of Popery; for it is a Sacrilegious Diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Honour from Chriſt upon oftentimes a moſt unworthy Mortal; thoſe Princes then that are <hi>Minores Coronae,</hi> that leſſen themſelves by giving their <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>power to the Beaſt,</hi> muſt needs diminiſh the Honour of their profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have ſo far ſtripp'd themſelves of their Principalities, that they have them not to dedicate to Chriſt: The retaining their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour unvouch'd, unviolate by any creature, and preſenting to the Honour of Chriſtianity a Supremacy unproſtitute, is the true Glory done by Chriſtian Princes to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If there were not the Liberty allowed to Nations to eſpouſe Chriſtianity to their Government, and to receive the Honour to themſelves of being Religious, and Chriſtian, as Nations; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Nations were worſe than that of the <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>the Law.</hi> For now People, as in the Body of a Nation, may not be ſo happy, as <hi>to have the Lord for their God.</hi> They may not crown themſelves with the chief Glory of Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> True Religion: <hi>Moſes,</hi> we know, often magnifies <hi>the State of the Jews</hi> to themſelves, in this particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Excellency of their Religion:</hi> He uſes it as a great Argument, that God <hi>loved the Nation;</hi> He told them, it was their <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> before <hi>the reſt of the Nations round about them,</hi> who had reaſon to defer to them, that they were <hi>a great,</hi> and <hi>a wiſe Nation, an underſtanding people,</hi> that had <hi>ſuch</hi>

                     <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing Chriſtian Religion hath the undoubted Evidences of Wiſdom, Truth, and Goodneſs; not only ſo ſuperior to all the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65165:90"/> Religions in the world, as to be <hi>the only true Religion;</hi> but much ſuperior to that under Adminiſtration of the <hi>True Religion</hi> it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews:</hi> It muſt needs be the happineſs of Nations to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſe it, as the publick National Religion, by the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity whereby they make valid any other Law, or Act, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the act of the Publick.</p>

                  <p>It is indeed generally taken for granted, that Nations are only judged as Nations in this world; yet if we cloſely examine, we ſhall find both in Scripture and Reaſon, very valuable grounds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi> ſhall not only paſs upon perſons ſingle, but in their Communities, as they are lock'd in with their Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and with reſpect to thoſe very periods of Time, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations into which the Communities and Aſſociations have been diſtributed; ſo that not only the people of every Nation come into Judgment together, but the people of every Generation, of this or that Nation, come diſtinctly into Judgment together.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs it is not ſo clear, that the happineſs and ſalvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is with any reſpect to the diſtinction of Nations; becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what other reaſons may be given, the union of all bleſſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to God and Chriſt, and of happy Spirits one to another, is ſo infinitely great, as to ſwallow up all diſtinctions; ſo that there is neither Jew nor Gentile, Scythian nor Barbarian, but God and Chriſt are all, and in all.</p>

                  <p>But ſtill there is reaſon to think the diſtinction of Nations is not ſo loſt, but that the <hi>Holy Seed</hi> is as the <hi>ſubſtance of every Nation,</hi> in which it is for ever (as it were by it ſelf conſerv'd:) <hi>A Seed ſerves God</hi> in every Age, which is accounted to the Lord for a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at that time, and when <hi>God writes down the people in the Book of Life,</hi> he writes them as under the head of ſuch a Nation; <hi>this or that man was born there,</hi> although they are all enrolled, <hi>as Citizens of that common City of Zion, the City of David, from whom our Lord ſprang.</hi> And though all Chriſtians are one <hi>holy Nation,</hi> yet it is ſaid of ſome very glorious, and <hi>happy State of the Church,</hi> (of which I will not undertake to determine) that after the <hi>diſtinct Sealing of ſo many thouſands of each Tribe,</hi> there was yet <hi>an innumerable company,</hi> not in a confuſion, but in a diſtinction; ſo as to be known <hi>to be of all Nations,</hi> Kindreds, People, and Tongues.

                  <p>To conclude this Particular, The honour of Nations themſelves, as well as perſons, wherein Religion hath prevail'd to ſuch degrees, as to be called <hi>National,</hi> is conſerv'd in thoſe that are ſav'd, even as the honour of the <hi>Angelick nature</hi> is conſerv'd in the <hi>holy and elect Angels,</hi> as the humane nature in the <hi>ſeed of Abraham, the father of the faithful, of them that are ſaved in all Nations;</hi> as in <hi>Iſaac, the ſeed of Abraham</hi> is called, as in <hi>Iſaac's children, the children of promiſe are counted for the ſeed.</hi> Thus the honour of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 7, &amp;c.</note> Nations is treaſur'd up in the <hi>elect</hi> of it; ſo that if we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Nation without Converts, it is loſt, as to happineſs, or as if it had not been, as the <hi>Tribe of</hi> Dan <hi>has no name among thoſe</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. National Religion contributes to the moſt happy ſtate, peace, and union of Nations: <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But National true Religion is a means fitted by God to the peace of Nations, and ſuch a means as is <hi>acceptable and well pleaſing to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, For the ſake of Religion; for Unity in Religion gives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency to Religion, and makes all the ſervices of it more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I have already ſhewn: It is alſo <hi>well pleaſing to God,</hi> as it ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the peace of Nations; which is of high price with the <hi>God of peace,</hi> and Chriſt <hi>the Prince of peace,</hi> who hath commanded us to <hi>ſeek peace and purſue it: To ſtudy to be quiet, to live in peace, as much</hi>

                     <hi>as lies in us, and if it be poſſible with all men;</hi> who hath branded <hi>the ſowing diſcord among Brethren,</hi> as one of the principal Abominations to him, but hath bleſſed the <hi>peace-makers, owning them as his children.</hi> He hath made <hi>truth and peace the ſtability of any time; theſe are the pillars that are the Lords, and he hath ſet the Nations he loves upon them.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Religion, by being National, is freed from the charge of being a deſign and occaſion of diſturbance.</p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Hearts of Princes ſafely truſt in it;</hi> thus it becomes the very ligament and ſinews of Government, a <hi>pia mater</hi> to the ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Authority, and makes Soveraignty eaſie and ſweet both to Prince and people.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65165:96"/>
                  <p> What but Truth can be weighed againſt this Peace?</p>
                  <p>And that not all Truth, but Truth dwelling ſo near the eſſence of Religion, the very purity of Divine Worſhip, that as it cannot be <hi>ſold</hi> nor <hi>parted with,</hi> ſo it may not be concealed: A man may not <hi>have it to himſelf,</hi> but with his <hi>Mouth muſt make confeſſion of it to ſalvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. True Religion becoming National, hath the deſence and ſecurity of National Wiſdom, Force, and Strength, againſt falſe Religion, and its force and endeavours to expel the true, and become National it ſelf. For <hi>a Nation divided againſt it ſelf in Religion, how can its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Intereſt ſtand?</hi> When though the main be agreed, yet if dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of an under nature are managed with high exaſperations, it muſt needs endanger the ſtaple Religion it ſelf, by weakning, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piriting, and dividing the ſtrength that ſhould ingage for it, while every one takes care for his private ſentiments, and is jealous of being undermined, or oppreſſed in them, the publick and common Religion cannot be environed and defended with that vigour and union.</p>
                  <p>A Nation united in Proteſtancy, is the greateſt Bulwark againſt Popery; what can ſingle Intereſts do in this caſe? Even Experience teaches thoſe that diſſent from one another in many things, even in National Reform'd Religion) to acknowledge this Union the Fort-Royal againſt the hoſtile Invaſions of Popery, which ſhould conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate them as far as is poſſible among themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. True Religion, as it is National, ſecures beſt againſt thoſe undermining Enemies of <hi>Atheiſm, Hereſies, Enthuſiaſm,</hi> wild and monſtrous Opinions, Prophaneneſs, neglect of all Religion, Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Lukewarmneſs, which take ſhelter and manage their defence from the diviſions in the Religion of a Nation, ſetled and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into avowed Sects and ſeveral parties; but National Union in a true Religion, ſtrikes them both with fear and ſhame.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The benefits and bleſſings of publick Religion, as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, come down upon a Religious Nationa, and all the truly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious parts of it, both in <hi>this world, and in that which is to come,</hi> according to the ſtrength of the Union in National Religion: And this is an intereſt far greater than that of Trade, warlike Defence, or the policy of Cities or Kingdoms. Accurſed therefore be that Irreligion or Diſunion that enfeebles it: <hi>He that lives without God in the world,</hi> as to the worſhip of him, and he that prodigally commits waſte upon a Religious Principle, is worſe than they that by riotous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65165:96"/> living or idleneſs, do their part to impoveriſh a Nation. He that upon Diviſion retires from the publick Religion without neceſſity, takes his Intereſt out of the National Bank or bottom, or ſullenly lets it lye dead: Such kind of partyings in Religion without neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are like the <hi>Hetaeriae</hi> or Cabals in Civil Government, Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without reſpect to the publick, and ſo the great damage of it an injury of great guilt, ſeeing we owe ſo much to the publick.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I have done what I intended in the arguing this point: I ſhall now conſider what may be objected to it, as an occaſion further to explain this whole Doctrine; and the great Objections I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in prejudice of what I have aſſerted concerning National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I reduce to theſe following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. When God gave the great inſtance and pattern of <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion,</hi> eſpecially as in a <hi>National Church;</hi> how much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did he found it, than is poſſible to be derived from our Saviours Inſtitution. He begun it in a holy Root, that ſprouted out and grew, and flouriſhed into a Nation <hi>holy to God.</hi> By his appointment they met together at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the <hi>ſolemn Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> as <hi>publique Ordinances.</hi> The <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and more eſpecially the <hi>High-Prieſts,</hi> were in moſt Authorirative Deputation from God, between him, and that peculiar people, that they might unite all as in <hi>One.</hi> The <hi>Temple, Altar</hi> and <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> were as the common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all the publique worſhip; and a great ſin it was to have mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied any of theſe, and ſo to have made a Diviſion.</p>
                  <p>They had <hi>Prophets,</hi> who were their extraordinary <hi>National Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> their Office and Sermons cloſely relating to the general ſtate. Laſtly, their <hi>Civil Magiſtrates</hi> were under the ſtricteſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, to attemper their Government and Adminiſtrations to the Religious Laws, given by God to that people.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all this, they had the <hi>Levites</hi> diſperſed through their Cities and Villages, to teach, and inſtruct in the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> the places wherein they aſſembled for conſtant exerciſes of Religion. But now what a ſilence is there of all theſe things, or any thing like them, with relation to Nations in our Lords appointment? His <hi>Apoſtles</hi> called men out of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> the then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Nations, into private and particular Aſſemblies, called Churches, under Paſtors particular to them, without any Rules for Chriſtian Magiſtrates, or expectation of ſervice from them; which argues, he did not intend <hi>National Churches;</hi> or if he did by the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſignifie any ſuch, it was not intended they ſhould
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65165:97"/> be in this dark and cloudy ſtate, wherein <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> has ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; it is reſerv'd for ſome more glorious State of the Church, ſome more eminent appearance of Chriſt, wherein ſuch <hi>Prophecies</hi> are to be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hence it came to paſs, the only Inſtances we have in Scripture, of Chriſtian Societies, the diſcourſes of them, the Rules in relation to them, are all fitted to private and particular Congregations; and where there are any ſuch ſpoken of, they are called Churches or Congregations; ſo that there is no Aſſociation in Chriſtian Religion mentioned, but under the name of a Church, to ſignifie Chriſtian Religious Societies, and Churches, are all one; ſo that there can be no National Chriſtian Religion, without a National Church: But there is no rule either of a National Chriſtian Religion in the New Teſtament, or a National Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A National Church, or a National Religion, muſt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a National Magiſtracy; the Church muſt be gathered in them, the Religion eſtabliſhed by them ſubject to their Laws and penal Statutes; and beyond this, thoſe that cannot be every way compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with the whole <hi>National Scheme,</hi> are looked upon as enemies to, or diſturbers of the peace and Government of the Nation, becauſe the Government and the Religion are incorporate together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Laws, and Religion, and Churches of Chriſt, are all in him, and depend upon him only; how far is this from a National Church?</p>
                  <p>To give firſt an anſwer to theſe Objections together: The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments already mentioned do mightily prevail with me that it is impoſſible Chriſtianity ſhould by any of its influences, ſo much as ſuſpend ſo abſolute a Natural Duty upon mankind as this, <hi>viz.</hi> to conſecrate National Aſſociations to God in National Religion, but that it is always the duty of Chriſtian Magiſtrates and people to unite in National Chriſtian Religion; Or that the Redeemer of mankind ſhould cut off ſo great a priviledg of Nations as that, to intitle themſelves <hi>Nationally</hi> to God, and his favour and bleſſing, and to make profeſſion of the wiſeſt and only true Religion in the world; or that the very proper and natural Glory of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>to make diſciples of all Nations,</hi> may not at all times be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by every particular Nation. However the <hi>Prophecies</hi> may be more literally fulfilled hereafter in the purity and univerſality of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>This being premiſed, I come more particularly to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65165:97"/> 1. Many of theſe things that are named, as found in the <hi>Church of the Jews,</hi> as a <hi>National Church,</hi> were not yet the Eſſentials of a Church, as <hi>National</hi> in general, but of that <hi>particular National Church,</hi> and typical of things under the Goſpel, as is plain in the expoſition of them in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and more particularly that excellent <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews:</hi> the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> the <hi>ſolemn Feaſts,</hi> with ſuch like, <hi>ſerv'd only as ſhadows of things to come;</hi> and the want of them argues nothing againſt National Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe things that were not Typical, or whoſe main and ſole intention was not to adorn and compleat that whole Frame, but reſted upon Univerſal Principles of Reaſon, Truth, and Duty, can never be abrogated, but are <hi>for our learning,</hi> that we through <hi>pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and comfort of the Scriptures may have National hope in God,</hi> and be obliged in our duty, even as they were. Thus the duty of Magiſtrates and people towards true Religion, of publick inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of publick Miniſters of Religion, of care for places of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Divine Worſhip throughout a Nation, continue ſtill, and need no new commands in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As to the firſt planting of Churches by drawing Chriſtians into particular private Societies, it amounts but to thus much, that Chriſt the Lord of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Church did not found his Church univerſal as neceſſarily diffuſing it ſelf into Nations; nor could it in reaſon be ſo.</p>
                  <p>For ſeeing it was in Divine Providence, for great and weighty Reaſons, of which it is not proper now to ſpeak, intended and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that hundreds of years ſhould paſs over Chriſtianity, ere it had the favour and protection of Supreme Chriſtian Magiſtrates, there muſt have been for that ſpace no Religion or Church, if there had been no other Form but National. The Church of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it was in thoſe days within Nations, Cities, Towns, and Villages, yet of low ſtature in compariſon of National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, till the Reign of Chriſtian Emperors, conſiderable indeed in it ſelf, and its diffuſion through ſo much of the world, but not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Laws or Governments, till long after its firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. And at all times upon the change of a Chriſtian Magiſtracy into a Pagan, an Apoſtate, an Heretical, or Idolatrous Succeſſion, or the complex of all, <hi>Antichriſtianiſm,</hi> which early invaded the Church, and even covered and obſcured it in ſucceſſion of time; the Church of neceſſity muſt fall back into ſuch a low ſtate, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65165:98"/> upon its obedience to the Law of Chriſt, and its own prudential accommodations to the ſtate of Times, without the Magiſtrates care and protection.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour therefore took care of the Catholick Church, which is of abſolute Divine Inſtitution, which is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that promiſe, <hi>The gates of Hell ſhall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it:</hi> To which belong primarily all the great and glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Scripture; to which are given originally <hi>Paſtors and Teachers,</hi> to propagate, promote, build up, and ſtrengthen it; and ſhall by virtue of <hi>Chriſts aſcenſion far above all heavens,</hi> be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly continued to it, <hi>till we all come to the unity of the Faith of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the full meaſure and ſtature of Chriſt</hi> in all his members. All other Societies of Chriſtians are but little images and repreſentations of this, in theſe its excellencies; and the more they participate of it, the more truly are they the Churches of Chriſt; But becauſe this is too diffus'd for one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, for one Frame to comprehend, there is therefore allowance given by Chriſt for leſſer Aſſociations of this Catholick Church, from the nature of the thing; and becauſe of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance of Nations and worldly powers at firſt, and ſince upon true Chriſtianity: Our Saviour therefore, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 18 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſly fixes the promiſe of his Divine Preſence in the ſmalleſt parts of this Church, where <hi>but two or three are gathered together in his Name,</hi> he hath aſſured, <hi>he will be in the midſt of them;</hi> ſo that it is hence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, the whole neighbouring diſcourſe centers in the leaſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies agreeing in Chriſtian Religion: For though it ſuppoſes firſt a greater number, <hi>(the Church,</hi> and <hi>two or three Witneſſes</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed) yet as it were in proſpect of the great fewneſs upon ſome exigencies of Chriſtians practiſing the duties of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity together, it brings down the promiſes of Audience in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to heaven, and preſence with their whole worſhip and ſervices to the ſmalleſt numbers, not by way of limitation to, but encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſo ſmall a number. And it is very obſervable, the very ſame declaration of Chriſt to the Apoſtles, <hi>whoſe ſoever ſins you remit, or bind,</hi> by the true Doctrine of the Goſpel, <hi>ſhall ſtand good in heaven;</hi> the very ſame is ſaid here to the ſmalleſt Societies of Chriſtians as to their Judgment and determination upon their own members, according to the Laws of Chriſt concerning the offences that fall out among themſelves, having the ſame Doctrine to proceed he committed to them, even as to the Apoſtles themſelves: Churches
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65165:98"/> are <hi>Pillars</hi> and <hi>Rocks of Truth,</hi> even as the moſt Excellent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and either, or all being no more, but <hi>Praecones,</hi> each in their kind, or Publiſhers of the Will of Chriſt, and his Truth declar'd in his Word, in the vertue of their being parts of the Catholick Church.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſon why our <hi>Saviour</hi> pitches upon ſo ſmall a number of <hi>Chriſtians, agreeing,</hi> is certainly this, becauſe he would appoint no other form to his Church, than ſuch as could live, as could ſubſiſt under any Civil Government whatever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friendly or unfriendly to it. He gave it no other ſhape, but what it might attain and keep under any ſtate of Civil Laws, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any enmity it met with in the world.</p>
                  <p>And this was moſt neceſſary, becauſe the Church of Chriſt was not confin'd to one Nation, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> was, whom God in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar manner ſingled out, and manag'd to the ſtate of a Kingdom, and Nation, by a mighty power, and out-ſtretched arm, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by the ſame, ruling it with an immediate ſenſible preſence, after he had form'd it by preciſe Laws, and ſetled the juſt bounds of all Officers in their Office, and appointed them the place of the exerciſe of it; whereas the Chriſtian Doctrine being indifferent to every Nation under Heaven, it did, as it made its progreſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert certain numbers to it ſelf at firſt, which had no priviledg of humane Laws or Powers, but the edg of all turn'd againſt it; ſo that the Form of Churches was compoſed to all the viciſſitudes of Providence they were to undergo; and that in all reaſon, muſt be in caſe of neceſſity, the very leaſt of Societies of Chriſtians, <hi>Two, or Two or Three</hi> (as our Saviour ſignificantly points upon ſmall Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties) for ſuch are moſt fitted to the worſt of conditions that could befall; leſſer, and ſingle bodies moving every way, and ſhifting for the gaining opportunities for the aſſembling themſelves, and preſerving their relation one to another, in the diſcharge of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duties, much more eaſily than any greater aſſociations could; for our Saviour intended all for uſe, not for Form; he minded not <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, Titular Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far I have pleaded the appointment of Chriſt, that the ſmalleſt numbers of Chriſtians may agree and aſſociate, and be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>But now, that this appointment is in bar of greater Societies of Chriſtians, is by no means to be granted; for it is moſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, our Saviour deſign'd all things under the Goſplel ſhould be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65165:99"/> reſtor'd to the Law of Nature, and the true Reaſon of Things.</p>
                  <p>Now according to that, the firſt End of all Society, is the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of True Religion, in more than ſolitude.</p>
                  <p>This deſire of enjoying true Religion in Society, extends it ſelf from the leaſt of Societies, to the greateſt, that are not too great for the Ends of Society: Our Saviour therefore, as he gave no Frame of poſitive Laws, or Worſhip, no <hi>Pedagogy</hi> of Precepts, ſo no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Bounding Churches, but that in caſe of ſtraits and exigencies his true Religion may be adminiſtred in the very ſmalleſt of Societies with confidence of his Favour and Preſence; when it hath freedom, it may enlarge it ſelf further and further; and if it have favour of Nations and Governments, aſcend to the greateſt; yet with this reſerve, That if in any time or place National Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity varies from the true Original Chriſtianity, as often it hath been ſound to do; ſo that it cannot, even in ſubſtantial things, be conſented in with a pure Conſcience, privater Congregations, even to the moſt particular, are always ready for Chriſtians to retire into; for ſo the Laws of Nature allow, where the Publick is not ſafe; and yet when the whole is not corrupted, nor liberty of joyning without commixture with thoſe Corruptions denied, there may yet be, there ought to be no Separation.</p>
                  <p>Thus the greateſt Societies are not in bar of the leaſt, when True Religion requires them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the leaſt are not in bar of the greateſt, when Chriſtianity is at full freedom; for it is cloſely allied with that <hi>Wiſdom, whereby Kings ought to Reign, and Princes to decree Juſtice; by which Princes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>ought to rule, and Nobles, yea all the Judges of the Earth, with that Wiſdom, which rejoyces in the Habitable parts of the Earth, and hath its delights with the ſons of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have therefore before obſerved, That Chriſtian Religion at the very firſt joyn'd it ſelf, as near as it could, to all Humane Societies made ready to it, as Families, Villages, Regions; and ſo far as the Rage of Perſecution would permit Chriſtian Societies, united them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto Diſtant and National Correſpondencies among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Now it hath been ſo unhappy indeed with the World, that in few Inſtances there hath been a Good State of National Religion to yield a full, conſciencious Compliance with. Yet this will no more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt the Thing it ſelf, than it does againſt any other of the wiſe and good Ordinations of God, or againſt the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65165:99"/> ſo immediately govern'd by God, and yet ſo often, and ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly corrupted in <hi>Judah,</hi> and more generally in the <hi>Ten Tribes;</hi> and yet to ſhew how, to the very utmoſt, without following a multitude to do evil, we ought to joyn with any that are good in a Nation, and with any thing that is good in National Religion, when <hi>Elijah</hi> had, as it were, deſerted his place, and the good influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence his being in publick might have had, and that God found him alone; He did by way of Reproof ask him, <hi>What he did alone in</hi>

                  <p>If Corruption would argue againſt any good Appointment, or Ordination of God, it would argue againſt <hi>Churches</hi> of the very <hi>firſt Form,</hi> or <hi>Conſtitution;</hi> thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> whoſe Corruption is ſeverely tax'd and threatned, yet are without any Cenſure as to their Conſtitution; and while S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>From whence I conclude, no Form of Churches can recommend things diſagreeing from the word of God, how truly form'd ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> be; for Churches are conſtituted for joyning in thoſe things that are agreeable to the Will of Chriſt, not in thoſe that are not; and yet Separation from Corruptions does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate Separation from <hi>Churches,</hi> while there are any Parts of Divine Truth and Worſhip preſerv'd pure to unite in; ſo great are the Obligations that lye upon all ſincerely Religious, to make true Religion as publick as they can in the ſeveral Societies that are found to ingraft it upon.</p>

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65165:100"/> 1. That there can no great matter accrue to either ſide of it, by deciding for, or againſt a <hi>National Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For allow a National Church, or if you will, a <hi>Congregational Church, agreeing</hi> in any thing, not agreeing with the Laws of Chriſt, or if either of them wants any thing neceſſary to our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt of theſe Caſes, Chriſtians may and ought to retire from the Irregularities of any ſuch Church, either <hi>National,</hi> or <hi>Congregational,</hi> that they may be pure from Corruption.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Caſe, Chriſtians muſt find out the ways and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, ſo far as is poſſible, whereby they may perform all the Duties commanded by Chriſt, though they ſeparate from either of thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> no further than to thoſe ends.</p>
                  <p>But if there be a Corruption in the Main, or a Defect in the Vitals of the Doctrine, or Worſhip of Chriſt, in either Notion, or Churches that will not be upon due Remonſtrances reform'd, then if according to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, Chriſtians gather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Aſſemblies, though leſſer, though but of <hi>Two,</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> they are aſſur'd of the Preſence of Chriſt; and no inconvenience of <hi>Rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>making Diviſions in his Church,</hi> ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them; for the Society deſerted is not <hi>his Church,</hi> but the Society that does deſert is <hi>his Church,</hi> ſuppoſing it retires ſincerely in obedience to the Laws of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, Suppoſe a National Church, not of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Chriſt in the Goſpel, as under that Name or Notion; yet if that ſtand good, which I have endeavoured to demonſtrate, that every Nation, to which the Goſpel is preach'd, is bound by the Laws of God eſtabliſh'd in Nature, and by the Laws of God and Chriſt in his Word, to plant true Chriſtian Religion upon its National Union; It will be ſtill every Chriſtians duty to joyn in, unite himſelf with, encourage and promote all that <hi>True National Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and not to ſeparate from it, any further than the Laws of Chriſt oblige him, that he may yield Obedience to all thoſe Laws: For it is the abſolute Duty of every member of a Nation to ſeek the Eternal Salvation of his Nation in his ſphere, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did of the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſo high an Orb, when he profeſs'd his <hi>great heavineſs and ſorrow of heart, even to the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf accurs'd from Chriſt, and prayed with his hearts deſire, they might be ſav'd.</hi> On account of which, in ſo many things he became to the <hi>Jews as a Jew,</hi> and wrote that <hi>Excellent Epiſtle to</hi>

                     <hi>the Hebrews;</hi> It being for that very Reaſon to me moſt probable, it was his, that he might make good all thoſe great profeſſions of Love to them; for though it was peculiarly directed to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Hebrews,</hi> yet it had an aſpect upon the whole Religion, and people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the ſcope of Adjuſting all the <hi>Moſaick</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law to the Goſpel-Mediation, makes plain, and ſo was in it ſelf moſt proper for the Converſion of that Nation, as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeeing their <hi>own'd and gloried in National Religion</hi> truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, led to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> juſtly now to have been their <hi>National Religion,</hi> if they had yielded obedience to their own Laws rightly interpreted.</p>
                  <p>Now if National Religion be an undoubted obligation upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the members of Nations, ſo far as it is true; Thoſe Laws, thoſe Officers that are, though not ordain'd by Chriſt, yet not contradictory to his Ordination, but neceſſary, according to Rules of Right Reaſon, to the Eſtabliſhing <hi>True Religion, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> muſt be ſubmitted to alſo, upon the account, and for the ſake of that <hi>True Religion,</hi> as <hi>National:</hi> But if <hi>National Religion</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from <hi>Truth,</hi> that Fundamental Liberty eſtabliſh'd by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Laws of Nature, muſt be always preſerv'd, that I before aſſerted, as giving Right to retire from all Societies not united in <hi>Truth,</hi> according to the Degrees of their defection from it.</p>

                  <p>I acknowledg Two things are neceſſary to particular, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of particular Societies, and the places where they reſided
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65165:102"/> Churches. 1. Conſciouſneſs, or mutual knowledg of perſons and their worſhip. 2. Conſent. This our Saviour teaches in that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, if <hi>Two of you ſhall agree,</hi> Mat. 18. and indeed not only in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, but even in the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> it ſelf theſe things have their reſemblance, but with this difference: <hi>In the Catholick Church</hi> the Divine Spirit running through all, knows them all that truly belong to it, and every one of them, one for another; and by their true Faith they all are united in cloſeſt conſent, in all things neceſſary to ſalvation, one with another, which <hi>Faith is kept from failing</hi> by the ſame ſpirit in them all that are truly of it.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there muſt be yet a more particular underſtanding, that Chriſtians have one with another, that they may joyn in the ſame Religious Acts, and mutually aſſiſt one another in them; therefore the union of the <hi>Catholick Church upon Earth,</hi> though it be the greateſt, the moſt Religious Society, the moſt ſtrongly banded and cemented; yet is not ſufficient, becauſe there is not that conſciouſneſs, or mutual knowledge of, and conſent in one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Faith and Worſhip in diſtant parts of the World, that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the <hi>Glorifying God and Chriſt in particular Churches:</hi> This is one great reaſon too why the <hi>Church-Triumphant,</hi> though inſeparably united with the <hi>Church-Militant,</hi> and every part of it, though more acceptable and prevalent in all its Adorations; yet cannot be communicated with actually, and explicitly; we may not ſollicit ſuch a communion with it here on Earth, becauſe we are not conſcious or knowing of any ſuch particularities in their State, or Action, as ſhould ground it; nor are we aſſur'd, that they are conſcious of any of our particularities: <hi>Abraham, the Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> are, for ought we know, <hi>wholly ignorant</hi> who we are, when we pray, or are exercis'd Religiouſly: There is a thick and dark Vail drawn betwixt the Church in Heaven and Earth, as to ſuch particular Communion; <hi>The Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit</hi> are only certainly and particularly known to us in that Higher Region; of them we are only aſſur'd, <hi>They know us, and all our actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To aſcribe the Honour to any other of the <hi>Inviſible Church,</hi> is to <hi>Idolize</hi> them, as well as to <hi>thruſt into things we have not ſeen or known.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus freely I acknowledg, the cloſeneſs and eaſineſs of Society, of mutual underſtanding, and conſent with one another, is the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65165:103"/> Foundation of particular Churches: Thoſe Duties of mutual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Aſſiſtances, Counſels, and when it is neceſſary, Reproof one of another, beſides the conſtant meeting in publick worſhip; That neceſſary ſeverity of diſowning in caſes of great, or incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible offence, ſuch perſons as walk in practiſes contrary to the Rules of Chriſtianity; not being poſſible, but in the neareſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction one with another, that the State of mankind allows at the ſame time to be, as publick too as it may be: The duties of Paſtors and Teachers towards the people, and of them towards thoſe that <hi>are ſo over them in the Lord, which conſiſt in watchng for their ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give an account for them;</hi> and thoſe ſouls therefore yielding obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce to thoſe Rules of the Word of God, the Adminiſtring of which is ſtil'd a <hi>Ruling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All theſe require a particular preſence one with another; and in ſuch a proportion of number one to another, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Duties may not be defeated by the over-number, but that the ſervices of all, one to another, may extend to all, may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all, may continually paſs, and re-paſs between all, and in which all may continually demonſtrate their <hi>conſent</hi> and <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But yet all theſe things cannot be in bar of a National Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſeeing that a Nation, as I have already ſaid, hath, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably muſt have a National Union; and if True Religion be fixed there, and carried along with that Union, it may well be call'd a National Religion at leaſt, and without any injury a National Church; the Agreement in the one carrying alſo an Agreement in the other, makes it ſo. And as in ſuch a National Union, though the ſtandard of all things, as of the whole ſtate of Law, Judicature, Trade, Buſineſs, Military<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrength of a Nation, be preſerv'd in Capital Cities and Courts, yet by the care of Government they are all in due proportions diſtributed, as the Blood in the veins by fit Channels to every particular, as it were in circuit; ſo the publick agreement in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſettles the Religious Intereſt of a Nation more eminently in thoſe things that do moſt repreſent the conſent of the whole in it; yet with due care of every part, and member of the Nation, to bring it home particularly to them, and making the mutual entercourſe in it free and open to all perſons, in all places where they have occaſion to paſs up and down, and maintain an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe one with another, that wherever they are, or have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65165:103"/> to be, they may enjoy the Freedom of publick Worſhip and National Religion, to which at all times they give a knowing, and even conſcious Vote that agree in it, the Aſſemblies being as it were in view, under a ſufficiency of <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies</hi> of the Nation together; and as National Union does not ſwallow up leſſer, or even Family Union; no more does a National any leſſer Church or Religious Society, except by mens own fault: And wherever men thus united come in the Nation, they gladly lay hold of the opportunity of joyning with any other particular Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to which ſameneſs of language and manners, give them ready ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion beſides particular knowledge; and that National Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo very particular as congregational, is no more reaſon to deny National, and reſt wholly in Congregational, than it is to deny Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational and reſt in Family Religion, or to deny Family and reſt in Perſonal Religion, becauſe theſe are each cloſer than other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third end of Churches comes to be conſidered that more particularly enforces <hi>National Religion,</hi> and juſtifies its <hi>Nationality, viz.</hi> That there may be a more illuſtrious, famous, and remarkable offer of Religion to notice and obſervation, for the drawing in, and congregating others to it. Thus a <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>Pillar</hi> and <hi>Ground, or Seat of Truth,</hi> and a <hi>magnificent Houſe of the Living God:</hi> And what more advantageous to this end, than a Nation united in the True Religion, which we know hath greatly the odds of particular Congregations, in this Illuſtriouſneſs and Magnificence? nor does this run out yet to the building <hi>the Babel of Rome,</hi> that would mount up as a <hi>Tower to Heaven;</hi> or as too ambitious <hi>Pyramids,</hi> that are often rebuked with Lightning from Heaven, for coming too near it; ſeeing, as I have before ſhown, ſuch an Univerſality enforced is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all the ends of publick Religion, Humane Society being ſo bounded by Nations, though all the Treaties of Nations of the ſame True Religion, may be managed to give it the honour due to it, that can be procurated in ſuch Treaties.</p>
                  <p>So much then as National exceeds, and extends it ſelf beyond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny narrower compaſs, and yet rejoyns it ſelf to and with it ſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of particular Congregations; ſo much does it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the magnificencies of Scripture concerning the publickneſs of Chriſtian Religion and the Catholick Church, and yet returns into the cloſeneſs of particular Churches with themſelves, and is the juſt point betwixt the Tyranny, Ambition, and endleſneſs of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:65165:104"/> 
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> and putting Chriſtianity <hi>under a Bed or Buſhel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>National Religion, and National Union in it, is as <hi>a city ſet upon an Hill, that cannot be hid;</hi> as a candle ſet upon ſo exalted a candleſtick, that gives light to all within it ſelf, and about it, even as far as the Fame of that Nation reaches.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Churches,</hi> much more, as riſing up into a National State, are <hi>the Glory of Chriſt:</hi> As therefore, though we may be in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard more exact in the moſt private, we go out of our Perſonal Religion into Family Religion, out of our Family Religion into Congregational, and as the Chriſtians at firſt (moſt probably) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws of Humane Society, went out of Congregations, into Conſociation of Churches in Religion; ſo we out of all theſe where National Union in true Religion allows it go into that Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al State, that we may build the honour of Religion to the higheſt, in ſo ſenſible and underſtanding a Conſent and Union in it, ſo publick an acknowledgment of God; and though hereby it be as a <hi>Net</hi> that draws in <hi>bad as well as good,</hi> even viſibly and apparently; yet when we conſider the poſſible care againſt it in particular Congregations, though ſtill National, when we further conſider the ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the ſtate of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyptick Churches,</hi> the doubt will not be ſo cogent, as to move National Religion out of the Nature of things.</p>
                  <p>The only remaining Doubt is, that thus National Magiſtracy becomes as the Head of ſuch a Religion, the National Religion is gathered and united in the Magiſtrate and his Laws, and that which ſhould only be united in, and depend upon the Laws of Chriſt, becomes ſubject to another Head; on pretence of which Magiſtrates have been attempted on too with force to bring their power to true Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer I give to this ſhall be very brief, in three Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I always own any pretence taken from exalting <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to enforce Civil Powers, to ratifie trueſt Religion into National Conſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>utions and Laws, is moſt deſtructive of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt which is not of this world,</hi> that is, to uſe force for its own promotion; and utterly ſubverts Government, ſeeing private perſons may under this ſhelter and diſguiſe, riſe up, and invade, and diſturb any Civil State or Government whatever: When Religion is our Birthright by our Laws, it may be by the ſame Laws defended; when it is not Prayers and Divine Reaſons
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65165:104"/> are the only way of introducing it into Nations: Beyond this is nothing but Popiſh, Antichriſtian Ambition, or wild and curſed Enthuſiaſm, with all their ſalvage effects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Where there is National Religion, even the National Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is firſt Chriſtianiz'd; ſo that there is no Headſhip, no Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but Chriſt and his Laws taking place upon a National State in profeſſion of him. If the Chriſtianity then be removed by falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood taking place inſtead of Truth, the Nationalneſs ſtays; but the Religion, <hi>the Candleſtick is removed,</hi> the Church is departed from it, and retires where it may be enjoyed in its own Truth. The form of the Church is the very ſame with that of the Catholick Church and Congregations: As it is National, the Headſhip, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization, is no other than National, but no more than the City of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or other Cities or Regions, made a Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> or thoſe other Churches; no more do National Laws or Magiſtracy make the National Religion. Chriſtianity, if received, ſettles there; if not received, or afterwards expulſed, leaves Laws, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, Cities, to themſelves, and ſo it deals with Churches, or Forms of them, of what kind ſoever.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. All Union in True Religion is free, rational, voluntary. It owns no compulſion of Laws or Magiſtracy, except in things morally good or evil; ſo that in this only is the difference from National Agreement in other things, that of Religion is voluntary, and by conſent. Princes and Governors may be <hi>nurſing Fathers</hi> and <hi>Mothers,</hi> by honorary Rewards and Encouragements; they may give all freedom to the true Worſhip of God, and protect it by Laws; they may f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce it in with the ſtrict obſervation of all moral obſervances; they may offer, and take care for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of Religion to be addreſſed to all their Subjects. Many ſuch demonſtrations of their Love to true Religion are allowed by God, but <hi>deſpotically</hi> to command, or compel, is not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of True Chriſtian, though National Religion. Chriſts <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom not being of this world,</hi> refuſes even the Magiſtrates Sword, much more that of private force, for the propagation of its moſt proper Intereſts. Our Saviours Religion hates all things of violence and cruelty, <hi>it is not of its Spirit,</hi> he does all by inſtruments of his own. And if Nations have made their Religion, yea the Religion of Chriſt, an eſſential of their Government; yet if it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65165:105"/> to the rule of Chriſt, Obedience to, and the good opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that Government, is a lower and leſſer Intereſt than Truth and O bedience to Chriſt: Chriſt never intended Chriſtianity for a Politick Engine or Expedient; yet for the conſervation of Government, in its full Rights, there is not a more concernful point of Chriſtian Religion, than the whole Doctrine of Patient Suffering with its reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; though it is unhappy for thoſe Rulers, that put Chriſtians upon the exerciſe of it, unhappy is that Power, that is ſealed to <hi>with Martyrs Sufferings:</hi> Yet every man owes to God a ſtrict account, why he is not of the National Religion; what reaſons counterballance to him the great reaſons given for National Religion, and therein ſhall receive <hi>his Sentence from Chriſt.</hi> If any, upon juſt reaſons, deſert a Congregation, though but of two or three (as I have at large ſet out) is a little <hi>Sanctuary</hi> reſerved to them by Chriſt, with a faithful promiſe of his preſence, where it cannot be enjoyed in greater; which are elſe, though with ſome diſadvantages in all other regards, to be preferred for their publickneſs, and not without great reaſons to be refrained from, or deſerted. If the Reaſons are not of weight, they ſtand at the <hi>Judgment Seat of Chriſt,</hi> who are guilty of a Schiſm againſt the Laws of Chriſtianity, the Laws of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Laws of Humane Society, and that according to the malignancy of it.</p>
                  <p>To draw this Diſcourſe now to a Concluſion, let me ſubjoyn ſome Rules by way of Inference, of certain good effect, to the management of ſo great an Intereſt, as I have repreſented National Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 1. That the <hi>Religion</hi> offered for <hi>National,</hi> ſhould in the ſubſtantials of it be all of clear, and undoubted evidence from the Word of God, and ſound reaſon from it; and in indifferents, or neceſſarily adhering circumſtances prepared by ſo publick a Spirit, as to project leaſt of doubt and ſcruple; that as Articles of Faith ſhould be ſo fram'd, as to beget no dividing Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, but leave room to the particular Judgments of Men, where points abſolutely neceſſary are ſecured; ſo all things of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal mode or form, ſhould be ſo freely and generouſly deſign'd, that every mans particular apprehenſion may be moſt at liberty, without which the probabilities of the <hi>National Religion</hi> are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65165:105"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 2. That in Circumſtantials of Religion, what is prepared and ſetled, ſo that it cannot be alter'd by any private diſpoſe, nor allowed to any private choice, without ſcandal to the publick; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſhould conſider his <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> on one ſide, as on the other, to preſerve himſelf from ſcruple, as in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> inſtance of <hi>eating;</hi> There is liberty on one ſide to <hi>eat all things,</hi> but this does not determine to a neceſſity of <hi>eating;</hi> that were not liberty: If therefore there be a good reaſon, an expediency <hi>not to eat,</hi> the liberty is more conſerv'd in <hi>not eating</hi> than in <hi>eating:</hi> So it is in the uſe, or not uſe of all indifferent things. Where then (as to the caſe we are now upon) the advantages for publique Religion incline this way, or that way, to the uſe, or not uſe of Indifferent Things, It is our greateſt liberty, to move our ſelves that way, and not to be deterr'd with the ſuſpition of the loſs of it by ſo doing.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems to be the <hi>Prophet Zachariahs</hi> reſolution, concerning the <hi>Faſts,</hi> wherein thoſe that would have them laid down, and others would keep them ſtill a foot differ'd. He firſt ſhews them of no value with God, then bids them love the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace, Zach.</hi> 8. 10. For though outward Forms, Uniformity, or Variety in them, are of no account in themſelves with God, but either way in the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, or the Variety; <hi>They that ſerve God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> are accepted of him; yet the angry diſſents and diſagreements that diſ-joyn the minds of men, and diſable the Union of Divine Worſhip, is like <hi>the covering the Altar with tears of complaint,</hi> and <hi>makes the offering unacceptable.</hi> That there may be the Unity God is delighted in, without Uniformity, is plain by the <hi>Harmony of the Evangeliſts,</hi> in their <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> where there is perfect Unity, yet without Uniformity; it is plain too by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods <hi>ſmelling a ſavour of reſt in the ſervices of the Church</hi> Univerſal, where there is great Variety, yet Unity. But the contentions and quarrels that often ariſe about theſe things, are the great cauſes of Gods diſpleaſure; what may moſt cure them, is then moſt to be deſired and choſen; but what that is, I will not be ſo bold as to preſcribe, whether a ſtrict Conformity, upon Reaſons in Government, beſt underſtood by Governours themſelves, or a compaſſionate Indulgence moſt acceptable to Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rule</hi> 3. They that without the violation of the true and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Rules of Religion, can moſt ſee, and uſe their liberty in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65165:106"/> theſe things, and thereby become inſtruments of the greateſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, are moſt acceptable to God: They that do not <hi>Tythe the Mint,</hi> and Cummin of Indifferent Things in <hi>National Religion, and Worſhip,</hi> with great noiſe and zeal (for that is the greateſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can be done to it), but take them ſo far as they are inſtruments of Peace, and uſe them in their own Indifferency, for the greateſt ſervice to the publique; They that inſiſting with any ſtreſs upon main things only, are moſt earneſt in <hi>turning many to righteouſneſs:</hi> Theſe are they <hi>that ſhall ſhine as Stars</hi> in the Nations <hi>Firmament,</hi> if not now, aſſuredly in Eternity.</p>
                  <p>They that take advantage of the National profeſſion, <hi>to call ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance,</hi> cauſe greater joy in Heaven than they that only think to ſecure themſelves with the purer Societies; Sure in this caſe God <hi>chooſes mercy in ſeeking and ſaving them that are loſt,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſacrificing alone by our ſelves, without regard to ſuch: Chriſt choſe rather to converſe with <hi>Publicans and Sinners,</hi> than what look'd l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, they are <hi>leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>National Religion,</hi> whether Rulers or People, that diſpirit Religion by an immoderate heat for <hi>meer Forms;</hi> that are ſo warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd for Indifferencies, to give reaſon to ſuſpect they are a principal part in their eſteem of their own, or the National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Whereas ſuch things, ſo far as they may be any way contributary to good, are beſt obſerved with greateſt ſilence and leaſt cry; being rather to be firſt ſo far prepared to acceptance and uſe, that there may be no <hi>noiſe of Axes,</hi> Hammers or Tools of force or compulſion about them.</p>

                     <hi>Rule</hi> 4.

That no man is ſo much bound to any Church, Communion, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Government, as to the true Religion, which is the firſt, and abſolute neceſſary; nor ſhall his withdrawing from any of them in things impure and offenſive to God, be charged upon him as ſin or Schiſm: All the <hi>putting out of Synagogues, caſting out Names,</hi> or <hi>Excommunications,</hi> ſignifie not any thing where <hi>God</hi> and Chriſt are in <hi>communion;</hi> and where thoſe on whom they fall are of the <hi>general Aſſembly,</hi> and <hi>Church of the Firſt born,</hi> of that truly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> which is the only <hi>neceſſary Church</hi> to be of, <hi>that we may be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The privateſt Aſſemblies, yea even ſingle Souls, ſo retiring that they may worſhip God according to his word, have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that God and Chriſt <hi>will make their abode with them, come and ſup with them and they with him, and they ſhall be written in the writing of Gods people:</hi> The Catholick Church is always provided for them, that they may not be out of the beſt Society under Heaven. The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65165:107"/> Apoſtle encouraged the Hebrew Chriſtians that might think them ſelves divided from the <hi>Jews</hi> that had been the only Church of God, by aſſuring them the Goſpel brought them into a greater Church than that, <hi>viz. the General Aſſembly and Church of the Firſt-born written in Heaven. This honour have all the Saints of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. All the evils that can be endured upon account of Chriſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him, will be abundantly recompenced by the ſaving of the ſoul, and that better and truer life. That Argument of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>He that loſes his life ſaves it, and he that ſaves it loſes it: And what ſhall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and loſes his own ſoul? or what ſhall he give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> ſtands always <hi>impregnable, that a man ſhould buy the truth, and not ſell it at any rate whatever.</hi> Thus for the Truth of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As to the Publickneſs of Religion, there are theſe great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſtian Religion profeſſes Love, endeavour of Good, and Salvation to all men, to every Creature, and hath antiquated all that <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> that neglects any for their <hi>profit to Salvation,</hi> though but Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That a man may join his Religious Services to any thing truly good in Natural or Revealed Religion, whether of Families, Neighbourhoods, Cities, Nations, or of voluntary Societies, ſtopping there, and keeping himſelf free from other mens ſins, ſo that the evil that other men adjoin to any thing true and good in Religion, being proteſted againſt, and divided from, does not corrupt what is good or true, but it may be enjoyed in the moſt publick way, while we have nothing to do with the evil, nor find it ſo mixt with the good, as to admit of no ſeparation. And what is wanting in the publick worſhip of that which Chriſt hath ordained and commanded, does not neceſſitate the total departure from that publick Worſhip, when the very Inſtitution is not chang'd by that want; for the true Chriſtian may make up that want in privater Duties: Thus they <hi>that feared the Lord, ſpake often to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>one another,</hi> without ſeparation from the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a free uſe granted by Chriſt of all things indifferent, or a freedom on each ſides to do, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not to do, where no moral evil adheres, or diſobedience to ſome expreſs Command of Chriſts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends either part. If then Religion be not drawn out of thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things wherein Divine Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Truth have plac'd it, and Traditions thereupon become Doctrines, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly carries al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng a <hi>rejecting the Commands of God,</hi> or a lower
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65165:107"/> eſteem of them for thoſe <hi>Traditions</hi> ſake; if there be no moral evil, or indecency, nor that a too great cumber be drawn upon Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Acts, every thing is by the Laws of Chriſt left to its own indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency, as Reaſon invites, or perſwades on either ſide to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not doing. All which ſets men free from a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> yoke in theſe caſes, and is the true Chriſtian Liberty. <hi>Eating</hi> or <hi>not eating, keeping a day, or not keeping it, Buying in a market, and going to a feaſt,</hi> without asking any queſtion for Conſcience ſake, without fear of the danger of moral defilement in thoſe things that other mens ſins defile only to themſelves, if we keep our ſelves pure, are plainly the Liberty Chriſt hath publiſhed to us; <hi>every Creature of God is pure, and not to be rejected, but received with thanksgiving;</hi> no ſin of man can pollute it to any, but himſelf. And this conſideration may ſtate to us the whole matter, that relates to order and decency.</p>
                  <p>That order which God hath eſtabliſht in nature it ſelf that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which are written with a Sun-beam upon things themſelves, are out of all diſpute. God is the <hi>Author</hi> of them, and not of the contrary, <hi>confuſion</hi> or <hi>indecency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That order which is the prudential contrivance of men, though not the ſame in all places, times, and to all perſons (as the former) yet ought to be chearfully complied with, as what is neceſſary to a National union in, and adminiſtration of publick Religion, both as to Officers and Things, ſeeing nothing can be ſetled without order.</p>
                  <p>Accordingly we find the wiſe and pious Governours among the <hi>Jews</hi> taking care and the people ſubmitting to ſuch Ordinations, and all under Divine Approbation.</p>
                  <p>The Order that is meerly of Humane poſition, and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moves the greateſt doubt, ſtanding in things that have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thin pretexts of Antiquity to give them ſome venerable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or that they are uſages already in being, or that they add the Imaginary decency, that Ceremonies ſet out Humane actions with. Now as to this they that have the power of impoſing, are equally to weigh the value of Religion it ſelf, and what that may ſuffer for the ſake of this order, and a great account lyes upon them before God; but for thoſe that are under ſubjection, I add further,</p>
                  <p>As to this ſort of order, I can only ſay this, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it no way turn'd into <hi>Doctrine</hi> (as the <hi>Phariſees not eating with unwaſhen hands)</hi> but declar'd againſt as ſuch, the conſequences of obſerving, or not obſerving, are to be ballanc'd, and ſo the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65165:108"/> of every conſcientious man to be determined.</p>
                  <p>On one ſide ſtands the freedom of uſing this order, as an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to do good, the conſideration of the peace of Nations, the National defence made more unite againſt falſe Religion at the price of Conformity to thoſe more Arbitrary Impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide ſtands a juſt fear for the purity of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either obſcured, or the freedom of it incumbered; or for the reputation of Religion, which often ſuffers by thoſe unneceſſary adherencies, as if they entered into the nature of Religion it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>I muſt yet allow the preference, in my own judgment, to that ſide by which National Religion is moſt ſerved; but with the full perſwaſion, that God receives both, if over-bitter zeal on either ſide be not offenſive to him; and with the conceſſion, that National Religion were more happy, if more free; but if love adjuſt to each their due allowance, the ſervices of both will be found with great acceptance in the common National Religion, as I doubt not their hands would be in the defence of it againſt the <hi>Invaſion</hi> of a <hi>National falſe Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if any be over-rigid, or ſevere on either part, they may <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi> the <hi>full rewards</hi> of their own ſociety, or party, but they leſſen the higher recompences of doing the moſt publique good. The ſtricteſt Laws, either this way or that way, in theſe things, are of mens own making, and exacting, ſo from them only <hi>they have their reward,</hi> who are zealous beyond their own <hi>knowledg,</hi> and the <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the <hi>matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all that hath now been ſaid under this Rule, I collect,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they that cannot agree to the publickly encouraged conſtitution of a Nation, ſhould yet point their worſhip, as much as they can towards it: They ſhould comply with all that is good in it, ſo far as they can be recieve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, without launching beyond their judgments.</p>
                  <p>Thus Chriſtianity was made as publique in all places, by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as they could, by adjoyning it to any principle of Truth, or to the natural ſenſe of Religion, they found any where; St. <hi>Paul</hi> gave ſolemn thanks to God in the midſt of all that ſailed with him, though a bad ſort of men. Thus he Preached the true God and Chriſt at <hi>Atkens</hi> upon their <hi>Inſcription, To the unknown God,</hi> upon the Fundamentals of National Theology, upon the wiſe ſaying of a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65165:108"/> 
                     <hi>Poet of their own.</hi> He thought it beſt to acknowledg all that was good in the moſt faulty ſtate of Religion, as an advantage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince what was bad, and diſagreeing to that good, and gaining men to unite with that whole element of Truth and Goodneſs, with which any ſparks kindled in them already were ſo cloſely allied, as to gain them to the whole.</p>
                  <p>How much nearer then, and cloſer may Chriſtians, and of the Reformed Chriſtianity, fall in one with another, if we valued what we agree in at a higher rate, as certainly we ought to do, then what we differ about?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The way to make National Religion moſt National, is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all the differences, that can be reconcil'd with true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; while they that diſſent in ſome things receive one another with a good, peaceable, holy, and publick temper of mind; as the great Argument and Inducement of which, we ſhould all pray for the acceptance of the holy ſervices of <hi>all,</hi> that <hi>call on the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes Chriſtians, but immediately unites them again) <hi>both theirs and ours:</hi> They and we whatever ſmaller diſtinctions make the <hi>(they)</hi> and the <hi>(we)</hi> are both one in <hi>our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We ought therefore to pray for the common benefit of all ſo united, though not bound up in the ſame form with us, for a gracious audience, and reception of their and our Worſhip of God, that ſo <hi>the Spirit of Love and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> in the main, may convey all our ſervices into <hi>one before God,</hi> where indeed (if they are as he requires) they meet ſtripp'd of all their <hi>outward Circumſtances, Form,</hi> and <hi>Ceremony; Faith,</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> being alone able to mount thither with them: And ſervices ſo raiſed can by no means be ſpar'd for ſmall differences in a National Religious Intereſt; for the <hi>Angels of all ſuch, behold the Face of our Father in Heaven.</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65165:110"/> never deſign'd to be Courts of <hi>Forenſick buſineſs,</hi> nor capable of Subordinating themſelves ſo, as that their Members ſhould be Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigu'd with long and tedious Suits and Appeals, removed from one part to another <hi>(worſe than going to Law before unbelievers),</hi> as the <hi>Romiſh Tyranny</hi> hath contriv'd. Whereas our Saviours methods for <hi>Complaint</hi> and <hi>Admonition</hi> in caſe of <hi>Scandal;</hi> for <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> in caſe of <hi>Repentance;</hi> or <hi>ſeverer Diſcipline,</hi> in caſe of <hi>obſtinacy;</hi> are natural, eaſie, and ſpeedy, as is plain to any obſerver. 5. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches allowed in <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three,</hi> ſhews the care of Chriſt, that there ſhould be a proportion betwixt the ſtrength and gifts of his ordinary Miniſters, ſince the Ceſſation of the <hi>Apoſtolick mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi> and their charge and truſt: For our Lord would not by his Inſtitution give any Reaſon to <hi>Moſes</hi> his complaint, <hi>I am not able to bear this great people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was our <hi>Saviours Inſtitution</hi> of <hi>particular Churches;</hi> and though it does not lay any abſolute Interdict upon the Truly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential, though Additional Conſtitutions, either of Nations, or other Humane Societies, proceeding according to the general max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, upon which Societies ſtrengthen themſelves: yet with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what is ſo done may not enact any thing by which the main and great Ends of this <hi>Inſtitution</hi> ſhou'd be defeated. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that the Inſtitution ſhould never be pleaded, but ſtand free from the Errors men fall too often into, in purſuit of the Maxims fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named; whereby they would aggrandize Society in Religious Things, or make it comport with Civil State: But that his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution ſhould be a ſtanding Rule, firſt to avoid them, after to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and reform them; or if they grew ext<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>drawing from them.</p>
                  <p>But to apply all this to our purpoſe, If the main Ends of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi> and <hi>particular Churches, Inſtituted</hi> by our Lord and Saviour, are obtain'd; There is no Encounter, but a moſt happy Agreement between the <hi>Natural Law</hi> of <hi>National Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Inſtitution of Churches,</hi> which, as I before aſſerted, are not to be drawn into a Deſert, or Wilderneſs, or ſhut up in Cells and Cloyſters, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to one point of the World (as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> would have had the True Church), but are to be fix'd in the midſt of the Univerſe, of Nations and Cities, as the very <hi>places</hi> of the <hi>Candleſticks,</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> (from which in juſt indignation to thoſe places, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of them, they are remov'd) in the midſt of the Buſineſs,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65165:111"/> Trade, and Converſation of the World; as is apparent by the <hi>Churches</hi> we read of in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Let then True Religion (as Chriſtianity contended, and will at laſt, in much higher Degrees, overcome) be as wide as the Univerſe; <hi>Let the Kingdoms of the World become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and his Chriſt;</hi> and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> will be as wide; Bring it into particular Societies, and particular <hi>Churches</hi> will be as many, as numerous as they.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Church-State</hi> is indeed a State of Separation: the Church-Catholick is a Separation from the Univerſe, becauſe there are <hi>Fallen Angels,</hi> unholy, and unhappy; becauſe there is a multitude of mankind in the ſame State.</p>
                  <p>But this is only for the ſake of True Religion, and the Happineſs conſequent upon it, that there is ſuch a Separation; and this the very <hi>Law of Nature</hi> agrees in.</p>
                  <p>Thus particular Churches, whenever they are a Separation from particular Societies; It is for the ſake of <hi>True Religion,</hi> and its due Adminiſtration: Reſtore that, and the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,</hi> become both one.</p>
                  <p>Then a <hi>Nation,</hi> and a <hi>National Church</hi> coaleſce into one: then Civil Societies in particular, and <hi>particular Churches</hi> grow into one; and God is pleas'd <hi>to dwell in them,</hi> and with greater delight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his <hi>Inſtitutions Natural</hi> and <hi>Reveal'd</hi> unite in one.</p>
                  <p>I have only one Caution to add, That the ſtate of Things hither to in the world is far from perfection; that whetherſoever we look, we can't find it; ſo that to be removing from one thing to another in hope of it, is perpetually to <hi>give</hi> our ſelves <hi>to change,</hi> except Things are no way tollerable, but the very Subſtance, Rules and Principles are corrupted, and that there are no Arts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and withdrawing from them left; we ſhould conſider how the pious <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> how <hi>our Saviour</hi> and <hi>the Apoſtles,</hi> how the <hi>undefiled names in Sardis</hi> mannag'd themſelves in the midſt of great Corruptions; what retreats from the Evils, and yet joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all that was good, was viſible in their practiſe, what kind of Diviſion the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>approved Corinthians</hi> made from the miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 19.</note> of the bad, without forſaking the Church, that we may imitate their Examples; and continue to do the greateſt ſervice to the <hi>Churches,</hi> or <hi>Nations</hi> we are members of; neither ſilencing our due Reſentments of Evil in our place and ſtation, nor rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65165:111"/> our ſelves from that <hi>Body</hi> we are of: But that All <hi>our Things</hi>

                     <hi>Rule.</hi> 9. In the laſt place, let us not think, Nations and other Incorporations of mankind ſlide away with this world, and are wholly loſt in the future ſtate of Things; and that only every man ſhall <hi>appear,</hi> and be <hi>judg'd</hi> ſingly by himſelf: Our <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> which is the <hi>day</hi> of our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> of our <hi>new life,</hi> and <hi>appearance in Bodies,</hi> will preſent us not only ſingle, but in our ſtate of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, wherein we were here in the world; even from Families to Nations, that <hi>we may receive the things done in thoſe Bodies,</hi> as well as in our <hi>own Bodies;</hi> then the Good we have done, or omitted to do; and the Evil we have withſtood, or been the occaſion of, or not prevented, when we might, ſhall be ſeverely accounted for by each in their ſtation.</p>
                  <p>Each <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> ſhall be ſurrounded with his ſphere of <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> wherein he was ſet here, and <hi>judg'd</hi> in that: And each <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Religion juſtified</hi> or <hi>condemned</hi> in that <hi>very Orb,</hi> wherein he was fix'd <hi>as a Star.</hi> And the ſeveral Magnitudes of both <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> will then be dreadful to them; however they have coveted, and been Ambitious of them here, if they have not inlightned their whole ſpace, becauſe their <hi>Judgment</hi> will be <hi>greater.</hi> Even every man ſhall be judg'd by his Services to the Publick in his place and ſtation, how private ſoever, if it hath never ſo little exceeded his ſingle capacity. And who in his Reaſon can think? God will then account with men for <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> ſmall and diſputable Things, howſoever zealous, or rather fond of them they have been in themſelves, and earneſt with others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: Thoſe things that have truly center'd in the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and <hi>the Salvation of mens ſouls, in Faith, Repentance, and a Holy Life,</hi> in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> will be of the only moment at that Tribunal.</p>
                  <p>This therefore ſhould be the moſt powerful perſwaſive upon us, to do all the good herein we can, in that Community wherein we are fix'd, according <hi>to our Talent,</hi> though but a <hi>ſingle one</hi> (much more if our Talents have been <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Five),</hi> that we may in that Day of <hi>Recompences enter into the joy of our Lord.</hi>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THAT which I will endeavour in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to the following Diſcourſe, be to preſent my Deſign and Method in ſtating the Nature of <hi>Scandal,</hi> that it may be more intelligible by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeen firſt, as in a Landſcape, in this Entry; and then to add ſome Conſiderations of great ſtrength to each part of that Undertaking, that have ſince arrived to my Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>As to the Method, I muſt in my own defence ſay, that I have to do with a Subject, in which ſo much of the <hi>deceitfulneſs of Sin</hi> is treaſured up, of ſo moveable a conſideration, (as Scripture from its own various ſhapes offers it to us) that
<pb facs="tcp:65165:114"/> it cannot eaſily be known, or trac'd: I hope therefore it will be allowed as ſome part of an <hi>Apology,</hi> that the Thread of my Treating concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, does not run ſo even, and ſtreight along, as it ought.</p>
                  <p>Further, I muſt take Sanctuary at the Reader's Candor, for the acceptance of my ſincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and any degree of performance in ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a task: I confeſs the want of the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Arts of Method, and a clear unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Style: Yet that I might take the trueſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſo multiform and vague a Notion;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I have taken hold of it in the moſt ſtrict and preciſe Deſcription I could frame, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all caſes of Sin, therein reſting eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon thoſe words Scripture uſes to convey the ſentiments of it to us. Thus <hi>Scandal</hi> is that by which we are drawn into any ſin, and off from the courſe of Duty, and Religious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo intangled in Guilt, diſeaſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and indangered as to Eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under a pretext of Reaſon or Religion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe <hi>I</hi> find the Scripture applies the Notion of <hi>Scandal</hi> eſpecially, when ſome of the grand Principles and Laws of Religion are violated under ſuch pretext; I have conſidered
<pb facs="tcp:65165:114"/> it, as referred to thoſe great Principles by ſuch ſacred uſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe there is a very peculiar, and moſt remarkable uſe of it, in the caſe of <hi>indifferent</hi> Things, by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when they are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, by being determined upon in practice with a <hi>doubting Conſcience</hi> (beſides other ways, wherein being uſed amiſs, they may become <hi>Scandals,</hi> or occaſions of it) I have therefore allowed a very peculiar Head of Diſcourſe to that Caſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe by deeply conſidering <hi>Scandal,</hi> and that, as our Saviour pronounces, <hi>Scandals muſt needs come,</hi> I found there muſt be ſome <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, Fundamental,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Scandal,</hi> that covers the whole State of Sin in general; I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the laſt part of my Meditation on the Nature of <hi>Scandal,</hi> to this <hi>Primitive, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, I reſume upon the whole, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of <hi>Scandal</hi> adjuſted to what I found upon each of thoſe forementioned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after it.</p>
                  <p>And herein I hope I may have hung up Lights to diſcover in ſome degree, and to avoid ſo dark and myſterious an Evil, as <hi>Scandal,</hi> though
<pb facs="tcp:65165:115"/> I have not been able to do it to thoſe degrees I deſired, or to compoſe into ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py an Order, or ſo perſpicuous an Expreſſion, what I had my ſelf clearer apprehenſions of. Thus far as to the Method.</p>
                  <p>Now for the ſtrengthening ſome parts of this diſcourſe by Conſiderations that have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to my Thoughts, ſince I had ſet an end to the Treatiſe it ſelf; they have ariſen from the cloſe obſervation of the Contexture of the <hi>Lord's</hi> Sermon upon <hi>Scandal,</hi> as it is Recorded eſpecially in this <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> 9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 17. Compared with the Debates of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Corinths,</hi> which are the moſt eminent Seats of the Doctrin of <hi>Scandal,</hi> we have in all the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour therefore, whoſe chief buſineſs into the World, was his recovery of it from <hi>Scandal,</hi> the Deception, and the Ruin of it, by giving ſatisfaction to the Divine Glory, for the diſhonour done to it by <hi>Scandal,</hi> hath bleſſed us with as Soveraign Arguments and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt either giving or receiving it.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord hath ſo embraced all ſorts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Scandal</hi> within this Sermon, that none can be exempted from the force and energy of
<pb facs="tcp:65165:115"/> thoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his Arguments, Inſtructions, or ſevere Denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations. But y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t, that they have a particular poignancy againſt <hi>Scandals</hi> within his <hi>Church,</hi> and one more particular kind, given by a particular ſort of Men, and directed againſt another par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſort of Men, will be moſt evident from the ſurvey I am now to give of his <hi>Heaven-born Diſcourſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The occaſion of it was the Diſciples coming ſolemnly to him with a grand Quere, in which no doubt their Ambition, a very ignorant Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, was deeply concerned. <hi>Who,</hi> ſay they, <hi>is the greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven?</hi> That is, as was generally underſtood at that time, in the <hi>Kingdom of the Meſſiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord, as he was wont on all ſuch Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, takes the occaſion of moſt Grave, Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Important Doctrine, and Admonition in return to it.</p>
                  <p>And that he might place in his Remonſtrance a moſt lively Emblem; He calls a <hi>little Child,</hi> and <hi>ſets him in the midſt of the Diſciples:</hi> and upon him diſplays theſe two great points of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That except a <hi>man be converted, and become as a little Child, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> either of Chriſt here in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:65165:116"/> his <hi>True Church,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Now though this being <hi>Converted,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming as <hi>little Children,</hi> be very profitably, and pertinently applyed to Regeneration; yet, conſidering it in the Scope, and whole Context, it is very evidently deſigned to that Humility, Unimperiouſneſs, ſenſe of the danger of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing for ever; Innocency, and Inoffenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from <hi>Scandal,</hi> by which others periſh: The reſemblances of which are found no where in this World ſo agreeable and ſignificant, as in ſome Properties of <hi>little Children,</hi> and their Nature; the manly ſtate of Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhewing ſo little hereof in this great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, as to require a perfect <hi>Converſion,</hi> and <hi>Regeneration</hi> to ſuch a ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond point of Truth is this, That whoever <hi>humbles himſelf,</hi> and becomes as ſuch a <hi>little Child,</hi> in thoſe Chriſtian Properties, is one of thoſe <hi>Great ones,</hi> thoſe <hi>Magnates;</hi> or the more any one <hi>humbles himſelf</hi> ſo, the greater he is; and he that <hi>humbles himſelf</hi> moſt, is the <hi>greateſt in the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Meſſiah,</hi> and ſhall be in the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65165:116"/>
                  <p> Theſe two great Points of Inſtruction being now ſettled upon this living Emblem, the <hi>Lord</hi> propoſes the very ſame to other two as great purpoſes of Admonition, although from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſpect or caſt of this one Picture: Conſider <hi>Little Ones,</hi> as the Emblems of Weakneſs, Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, liableneſs to Danger and Injury, of little Defence and Reſiſtance to any Aſſault; and ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> declares:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whoever <hi>receives</hi> ſuch a <hi>little one in his name,</hi> that is, upon the account of Profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, into a juſt eſteem, value, and care, of cheriſhing ſuch a one in that Holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſecuring him, as far as he can, in the Bleſſedneſs of that ſtate; receives, that is owns and acknowledges with Honour, Chriſt himſelf, and the kindneſs is accepted, as if it were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately placed upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if any one <hi>Scandaliſes,</hi> ſets a ſtone of <hi>Offence</hi> and Ruin, in the path of ſuch a <hi>Little One,</hi> by which he falls from, or in, his Profeſſion of Chriſtianity to his Deſtruction, the <hi>Lord</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces <hi>a Woe</hi> upon ſuch a one, as dreadful as the Proverb imports, <hi>It were better that a Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone were hung about his Neck, and he were caſt into the depth of the Sea:</hi> Which as it peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:65165:117"/> dooms the Profeſſed, obſtinate <hi>Scandaliſer,</hi> ſo it warns all of managing themſelves ſo in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, as to caſt off all <hi>Offence</hi> and <hi>Scandal</hi> from it, and to encourage the tendereſt in it, to ſtrengthen, and promote them.</p>
                  <p>Hereby then, <hi>our Lord</hi> hath deſigned the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the whole ſtate of Chriſtianity from the harm and danger of <hi>Scandal;</hi> for in theſe <hi>Little Ones</hi> he comprehends,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe, who in regard of their being new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born out of the State of Univerſal <hi>Scandal,</hi> are in danger of being re-intangled in its Net, or in regard of any other diſadvantage, or liableneſs to <hi>Scandals</hi> miſchief, are the <hi>loſt,</hi> as our Saviour after ſtiles them, and the weak, though not the young, (as the Apoſtle names them.) Now if ſuch are ſecured, all are ſecured: For if a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans carriage be ſo off from the danger of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſing,</hi> as not to <hi>Scandaliſe</hi> the <hi>weak,</hi> the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will be much leſs in danger to be <hi>offended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thoſe are the <hi>weak,</hi> and the <hi>Little Ones</hi> to us, who appear to us under any ſuch diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, though indeed they are not; as he that <hi>doubts,</hi> and dares not do what others profeſs to do on great aſſurances, ſeems weak to them that <hi>doubt</hi> not, but are ſo aſſured; and then the
<pb facs="tcp:65165:117"/> Precept of Chriſt takes as great hold of us, in all our Adminiſtrations towards them, as if they were really ſo. Now what a Wall of defence were this to Chriſtianity! what a happy ſtate would the ſtate of it be! if we were all moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towards thoſe, with relation to their ſafety for Eternal Happineſs, who ſeem the loweſt, weakeſt, leaſt to us in that Profeſſion?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Term, <hi>Little Ones,</hi> expreſſes a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation under the <hi>Great Ones:</hi> Now that they may not aſſume over the <hi>Little Ones,</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> firſt affirms, with his uſual Aſſeveration, that none can be <hi>Great,</hi> or any thing at all in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that is not humble and inoffenſive, as a <hi>Little One.</hi> And that if any that takes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a <hi>Great One,</hi> thinks he has priviledge to do as he pleaſes, either by Impoſition, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periouſneſs over the <hi>Little Ones,</hi> and does not in all points of Chriſtianity, demean himſelf as the leaſt under one common <hi>Lord,</hi> the Lords dreadful Commination hangs over him, he is in danger to be One of the Grandees in Torments.</p>
                  <p>On thoſe things therefore, that lye within the Compare betwixt the <hi>Great Ones</hi> and the <hi>Little Ones,</hi> does the Finger of the Lords Diſcourſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially point.</p>

                  <p>And becauſe whoever <hi>Scandaliſes</hi> others, is firſt <hi>Scandaliſed</hi> himſelf, and they alſo, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Scandal</hi> from others, have ſome great <hi>Scandal</hi> within, upon which that from without catches; he therefore ſo ſeverely cautions on all ſides againſt the <hi>Scandal</hi> of the <hi>Right Eye,</hi> the <hi>Right Hand,</hi> the <hi>Right Foot,</hi> and prefers to every mans choice the diſmembring any of them, rather than that the whole Body joyned to that Member, ſo fettered with <hi>Scandal,</hi> ſhould be <hi>caſt into Hell, where their Worm dies not,</hi> and their <hi>Fire is never quenched,</hi> the <hi>dreadful end of Scandal.</hi>

                     <hi>The Son of Man is come to ſeek and ſave that which is loſt;</hi> and the Argument is raiſed to the height, as it is exemplified in the <hi>Father of the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth, named after Chriſt; whoſe will it is not,</hi> that ſo much as <hi>one</hi> (and yet when <hi>one</hi> only is in the danger of <hi>Scandal,</hi> Who does not look upon him as a Singulariſt, eſpecially if <hi>one of the leaſt too,</hi> and reject him?) <hi>ſhould periſh,</hi> but is pleaſed in the preſervation of <hi>one</hi> ſuch; even as the <hi>joy of one Sheep,</hi> that is <hi>loſt</hi> out of a <hi>hundred,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſenſibly the <hi>joy of the ninety nine</hi> that were not in hazard.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A Method that allows no ſin, and yet deſerts none, till they deſerve to be accounted but as <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> or <hi>Publicans,</hi> to whom yet a due meaſure of Chriſtian Charity is to be preſerved.</p>

                  <p> Which Method it is not my buſineſs now to enter into the Controverſal part of, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as of great moment, that the <hi>Doubting</hi> of the lawful uſe of <hi>Indifferent Things</hi> in Religion, falls not into the account of any of thoſe <hi>Treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Lord</hi> ſpeaks of; and that, as if it were on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe leſt the thing ſhould be miſtaken, a moſt different Method is in that Caſe commanded by the <hi>Apoſtle of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here therefore give me liberty to compare, in ſome things which I have omitted in the body of the Diſcourſe, the Sermon of our <hi>Lord</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, He that doubts in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things, and cannot conform to what others do, and would be conformed to in, is not commanded by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to hear the <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>two,</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> nor the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it ſaid by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> they that will not <hi>hear</hi> on ſuch accounts, ſhould be as <hi>Heathen-men,</hi> or <hi>Publicans,</hi> (or as we ſpeak, <hi>Excommunicate)</hi> both which are very notorious in the <hi>Evangeliſts Records,</hi> in the Caſe of the <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> there ſpoken of, which aſſures us they are of another Nature.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> urge as from our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that what is in theſe Caſes <hi>bound on Earth,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65165:120"/> ſhall be <hi>bound in Heaven;</hi> or <hi>what is looſed on Earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven;</hi> that there ſhall be any obligation on the <hi>doubting Conſcience</hi> by the <hi>Churches Canons,</hi> or any ſuch diſcharge of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God or it ſelf by obeying them: But every Man in this Caſe is to <hi>hear</hi> his <hi>own Conſcience,</hi> there every thing of this nature is <hi>bound</hi> and <hi>looſed;</hi> there every <hi>word</hi> or <hi>matter</hi> is <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, there is no Injunction of <hi>telling the fault</hi> of Non-Conformity, if any be aggrieved at it, in that gradation from <hi>one</hi> to more, and ſo to the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s command is, Firſt, Not to <hi>Judge,</hi> or <hi>Deſpiſe,</hi> if that may keep <hi>Indifferents</hi> to their Equipoiſe; if not, the Command is, not ſo much as by <hi>Example</hi> to <hi>Scandaliſe,</hi> or draw any that <hi>Doubt</hi> to act againſt, or over their <hi>Doubt</hi> in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things, becauſe they are but <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;</hi> for that is to <hi>ſin againſt the Brethren,</hi> the <hi>weak Brethren;</hi> as at the leaſt we eſteem them: Now in theſe Caſes, <hi>to ſin againſt the Brethren, is to ſin againſt Chriſt in his Law againſt Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in that all things are of ſo diverſe a frame and aſpect in the <hi>Lords</hi> Preſcriptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Treſpaſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>Directions</hi> in caſes of various apprehenſions in things of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:65165:120"/> wherein one great part may be guilty yet of great <hi>weakneſs</hi> and miſtake, and that none of the Methods ordered in the one, is ſo much as mentioned in the other, or once intimated; it argues very evidently, that variety, and as various practices in <hi>indifferent</hi> Things, though joined with ſuch miſtake and weakneſs, are none of the <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> had regard to. And ſince the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> puts all under the notion of <hi>Scandal,</hi> wherein the weaker part is either drawn into ſin, enfeebled in the vigour, diſquieted in the true peace of Conſcience, or ſo much as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,</hi> by being incompaſſionately neglected in his <hi>Doubt;</hi> the whole Caſe is brought under the force of our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Sermon againſt <hi>Scandal,</hi> that none looking upon themſelves on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, as <hi>Great</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom of</hi> God, in the <hi>Church,</hi> or in the <hi>Chriſtian Profeſſion</hi> (let thoſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts be whatever they can be preſumed to be) ſhould by any ſort of Imperiouſneſs, whether Command, rigorous Treaty, or <hi>Example,</hi> that <hi>deſpiſes all</hi> that do not follow it, impoſe upon the <hi>Little Ones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all which let me have the Readers patience to add this one Obſervation, That the <hi>Evangeliſt Mark</hi> makes the occaſion of this, or a like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb facs="tcp:65165:121"/> of the <hi>Lords</hi> upon <hi>Scandal,</hi> That the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were much diſpleaſed that one did <hi>caſt out Devils in Chriſts name,</hi> that did not <hi>follow them,</hi> that did not ſeem, and indeed was not of their way, in the appearance of Things. But our Lord, with great Compaſſion, accepts him ſo far as he was come. For, ſaith he, <hi>He that is not againſt us, is on our part.</hi> He that, although in a different Company, or Mode, does the ſame things we do, and does nothing in oppoſition to our Great Deſign, is on <hi>our ſide.</hi> And ſo he proceeds into a ſimilar Diſcourſe of Kindneſs to, or <hi>Scandal</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Diſciples, though <hi>Little Ones.</hi> And if we ſuppoſe it the ſame Diſcourſe as in St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> and that this <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> had not an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate regard to the occaſion; yet in that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected it with ſuch an occaſion, and that by the Divine <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> it teaches us how much ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is adjuſted to ſuch an occaſion; for guided by the Holy Spirit, the things are ſo laid together.</p>
                  <p>Now that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had his Eye upon theſe ſo famous Diſcourſes, beſides the Reaſons I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven on this Head in its due place, it is evident to me further he had ſo, by his Repreſentation of himſelf in a <hi>Figure,</hi> all along the ninth <hi>Chap.</hi> of his
<pb facs="tcp:65165:121"/> Firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> in the very heart of a Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Scandal;</hi> as that <hi>Perſon</hi> that <hi>humbles himſelf,</hi> as a <hi>Little Child,</hi> in ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtances: His Little-Child-like Inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs, his eaſie Receſſion from his Juſt Rights for the <hi>Goſpels</hi> ſake, his <hi>Inoffenſiveneſs</hi> and <hi>Deſire to pleaſe all,</hi> to <hi>win</hi> upon all, that they might <hi>be ſaved,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>One thing more I cannot but yet adjoin, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is ſo wary of Impoſing upon any one in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things, appertaining to Religion, in a poſitive, or affirmative kind of obſervance, that though for the avoiding <hi>Scandal,</hi> he dehorts from <hi>Eating Meats,</hi> or <hi>drinking Wine,</hi> that may <hi>ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſe</hi> any in the very Eye of their <hi>Doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and draw them into Sin: yet he no where, to the ſame purpoſe of avoiding <hi>Scandal,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades to the eſteeming, or obſerving a <hi>Day to the Lord;</hi> though another may be <hi>Scandaliſed</hi> if he does not ſo.

                  <p>Of which <hi>Scandal, our Saviour</hi> was in a deep and intenſe Contemplation in this Chapter, and of the ſtate of things becauſe of it, both in his <hi>Church</hi> and the <hi>World;</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> eſpecially, as it confines upon his <hi>Church,</hi> is in the Neighbourhood of it, and view of what is done in it; or indeed, as within the Armes of it, by a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, though an unſound and inſincere Profeſſion; for ſo there is the <hi>World</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as the <hi>Church</hi> in the <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:65165:123"/>
                  <p> The Lord turns himſelf to behold and obſerve this <hi>Scandal,</hi> how it diſcharges it ſelf on all ſides with Woe, Miſchief, and Ruine; and with Compaſſion foretells and warns all of it, as of the moſt deſtructive way of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the moſt to be abhorred kind of Miſchief and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>This muſt needs make every thinking Chriſtian afraid of <hi>Scandal,</hi> of having any thing to do with it, either in giving, or receiving it; and much more of being a Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Puſher of it on in the World, and moſt of all in the <hi>Church.</hi> Now to this whole Diſcourſe there will be a continual occaſion to have recourſe in this Treatiſe: But the words themſelves offer to Conſideration theſe Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the preſent ſtate of the World is ſuch, that <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals muſt needs come. Scandal</hi> is very preſſing, and crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in upon the World; in regard of its multitude, its Name is <hi>Legion;</hi> it throngs the World; <hi>our Saviour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it in its number, <hi>Scandals:</hi> In regard of its vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, or importunity, it muſt needs be that <hi>Scandal</hi> comes. It thruſts in every where, it perverts the beſt things, and twines about them; it plays in things Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, how much more in things purely Evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal comes,</hi> it <hi>comes</hi> as an Eagle haſteth to the Prey; it <hi>comes</hi> ſupping, and blaſting as an Eaſt Wind; it <hi>comes</hi> as an Invader with its Troops. And the World, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is it to receive <hi>Scandal?</hi> It calls for, and invites it, it opens all Gates and Doors to it; it even ſurrenders and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays it ſelf to it; it is mad after <hi>Scandal,</hi> both to give, and receive it: <hi>It muſt needs be</hi> then that <hi>Scandals come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>World</hi> lies under great Miſery, becauſe of the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 2.</note> multitude of <hi>Scandals,</hi> the Efficacy of <hi>Scandal</hi> upon it: It is more miſerable, in regard of <hi>Scandal,</hi> than meerly in regard of Sin. For when <hi>the Lord</hi> Emphatically denounces <hi>a Woe upon the World,</hi> becauſe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> he intends ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, than the Scripture generally declares againſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:123"/> Sin, and Sinners; for that is a known Caſe, that there is a <hi>Woe upon</hi> Sin; <hi>Our Saviour</hi> remonſtrates this caſe as more rarely, and yet of all moſt neceſſary to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, obſerved, and profoundly conſidered. And though it will appear, it is always in the Senſe of Scripture joined with Sin; yet it hath thus much more of Danger in it, than that meerly it is ſinful: It is Sin ſome way guarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt Divine Truth, and ſo holds <hi>its Goods more in Peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its wound is no leſs deadly, yet more ſecret and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and therefore the worſt ſort of Death: It is an Ambuſh of Death.</p>
                  <p>In the Sin of <hi>Scandal</hi> moſt eminently it is, even as in that moſt Enchanting Sin, That <hi>a Man goes after it, as an Oxe to the Slaughter, and as a Fool to the Correction of the Stocks; till a Dart ſtrike through his Liver: As a Bird haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Snare, and knoweth not that it is for its Life: Scandal wipes its Mouth,</hi> when it deſtroys, and ſays, <hi>It hath done no wickedneſs; when it ſpeaketh fair, there are ſeven Abominations under it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As againſt thoſe Men of <hi>Scandal,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Scandal</hi> it ſelf, hath the moſt merciful <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World made his keeneſt Remarks.</p>

                  <p>Other the like Tranſlations of the ſame, and other Words of like Importance, from their Native to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral intendment, might be gathered together, but that this one ſo plainly leads us into the main point, and is ſo pregnant for the deſcribing <hi>Scandal;</hi> which may be thus repreſented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal</hi> is a prevailing Temptation to ſome great Sin, or courſe of Sin, cauſing the Soul to fall before it, or catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inwrapping the Soul in it, and all the dreadful Conſequences of it, covered under the diſguiſe and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence of a <hi>Principle of Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Doctrine of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> to its greateſt Miſchief and Ruine, if not recovered from it, by the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> and <hi>ſincere Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Scandal</hi> is thus when it prevails, when it ſucceeds to its unhappy Effect of <hi>Scandaliſing:</hi> For a <hi>Scandal</hi> may be offered, and not take. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> had a <hi>Scandal</hi> offered him by <hi>Peter</hi> his own <hi>Apoſtle: Thou art a Scandal to me,</hi>

                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 16. 22, 23.</note> ſaith our Lord, when he preſented him a pretext, a fair ſhew of Reaſon againſt ſuffering, which was the very Law
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65165:125"/> of his Mediation in the World, impos'd upon him by God. The Suffering yet of ſo Innocent, ſo Divine, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Perſon, look'd like a Prodigy, and monſtrous por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> not once to be ſpoken or thought of, <hi>Be it far from thee, Lord;</hi> but our <hi>Saviour</hi> immediately diſcharg'd himſelf of it, in that ſevere rebuke, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind me Satan.</hi> Thou art in this to me an <hi>Angel of Satan,</hi> the firſt Inventer, the ſupream Creator of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Saints, and Servants of God, have <hi>Scandals</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually contrived into their Paths; <hi>but God witholds their Feet from being taken; He hath charged himſelf with them, to keep them in all their Ways: He bears them up in his Hand, that they may not, to their Ruine, daſh their Feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any of theſe Stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandals</hi> are ſo many, and ſo great, as <hi>to undoe, if it were poſſible,</hi> the very Elect; but for the <hi>Elects ſake,</hi> the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective Power of <hi>Scandal is ſhortened.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Scandal</hi> is a <hi>Temptation;</hi> what the <hi>Evangaliſt Matthew</hi> calls being <hi>Scandaliſed,</hi> or <hi>Offended,</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt Luke</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal</hi> differs nothing from that Deſcription of the <hi>Apoſtle James:</hi> Every man is tempted, when he is drawn <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 14.</note> away of his own Luſt, and enticed. Then Luſt, <hi>when it hath conceived, brings forth Sin, and Sin, when it is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, brings forth Death.</hi> I ſay it differs nothing, but that in <hi>Scandal</hi> the <hi>Temptation</hi> is covered: Luſt, Inordinate Affection, is always at the bottom of <hi>Scandal:</hi> All <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> againſt Religion, or any of the Truths, Commands, or Duties of it, have their Root in Luſts and ſinful Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within: Herein they are juſtly chargeable to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; the <hi>Scandal</hi> within is the great <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that hath an impure Affection quenched into <hi>the love of the Law of God,</hi> hath nothing to <hi>Offend,</hi> or <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal 119. 156.</note> him. <hi>Scandal finds no place in him: He that loves his Brother,</hi> and God in him, <hi>hath no occaſion of Scandal</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 John 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>in him.</hi>

                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65165:125"/>
                  <p> But <hi>Scandal</hi> is <hi>Temptation</hi> ſo covered, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and therein it differs from meer <hi>Temptation.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Temptations</hi> to Sin are barefac'd, and have nothing but Pleaſure, Profit, or Vain-Glory to bait the Hook with; <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the Eye, the Pride of Life;</hi> all which leave the ſin naked, or the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering is at leaſt ſo thin, that Conſcience is not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon. But <hi>Scandal</hi> hath the ſeemingly fair <note place="margin">☜</note> Recommendation of a <hi>Principle of Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> how falſe ſoever.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, though in a free way of ſpeaking, a man is <hi>Scandaliſed</hi> by his <hi>Right Eye, his Right Hand, his Right Foot,</hi> interpreting them of his Luſt getting the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant over his Judgment and Conſcience; that has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of excuſe, but that he in whom it dwells has made it ſo neceſſary to him, that it is become part of himſelf; yet ſpeaking more accurately, and according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral courſe of Holy Writing, <hi>Scandal</hi> is <hi>Temptation</hi> ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed and ſheltered; there is ſome Screen betwixt the Eye of Conſcience, and defenceleſs Guilt; ſome Attire of Vertue or Reaſon about the Sin.</p>
                  <p>There may be ſome places, where <hi>Scandal</hi> may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near ſignifying nothing but <hi>Temptation;</hi> but generally there is as much difference, as between <hi>Davids</hi> Fall into Murder and Adultery; and <hi>Peters</hi> Denial of <hi>his Lord;</hi> the one was <hi>plain Temptation,</hi> the other <hi>Scandal,</hi> ariſing from the, to him, uninterpretable Suffering of our Saviour; though both were great and grievous Sins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Scandal</hi> is a <hi>Temptation</hi> to ſome great Sin, or courſe of Sin: For though the leaſt Sin introduc'd upon the Counterfeit of Religion, and Reaſon, is truly <hi>Scandal,</hi> and partakes in its <hi>Woe.</hi> Yet thoſe <hi>Scandals</hi> of daily almoſt unavoidable Incurſion in this imperfect State are broken in their deadly effect, by the daily and general Repentance and deſire of Pardon, and Faith in the Blood of Jeſus, all true Converts live in the Practice of.</p>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Who can underſtand his Scandals?</hi> Deliver thou me from ſecret ones, may every good man pray. <hi>But keep back thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant from Inſolent Scandals, that they may not have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> ſo that <hi>I be Innocent and free from the great Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſins that <hi>Scandal</hi> precipitates upon, may be either in the refuſal, diſavowment, rejection, or deſpight to ſome of the prime manifeſtations of God in the World, in Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Unbelief, or ſome great Enormity of Practice; and it may be abſolv'd and finiſhed in ſome Notorious Act of Sin, or may run through the whole Courſe of a mans Life, in an habitual State of ſin, or Tranſgreſſion of the Rule, that he acts in all a-long, Lives and dies in this <hi>Snare of Satan,</hi> in this <hi>Captivity</hi> under him.</p>
                  <p>It may be partial only, there being a reſerve of the Soul preſerv'd by Grace, by which the renewed Soul recovers it ſelf; as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Offended,</hi> or <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalis'd</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the Night of his Paſſion; and <hi>Peter</hi> in a fouler manner; and yet theirs, even <hi>his Faith did not fail.</hi> They and he moſt Eminently eſcap'd out of <hi>the broken Snare.</hi> But men devoid of any Principle of true ſaving Grace, are, though in ſeveral degrees, lock'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Scandal,</hi> and cannot be reſcued out of it, but by a <hi>Renovation</hi> to <hi>Repentance,</hi> the <hi>firſt Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, even the beſt men, under the power of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as we now diſcribe it, are for the preſent inwrap'd and involv'd; ſo that the whole man ſeems to fall, and the whole ſtrength for that time ſo far, as is viſible, is taken Captive.</p>
                  <p>Now by all this that hath been ſpoken, it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable, that a Man is never <hi>Scandaliſed,</hi> but when he ſins; he is not <hi>Offended</hi> in this <hi>Scripture-ſenſe,</hi> but when he himſelf Offends: To be juſtly diſpleas'd with other mens ſins, or defiling Religion with impure mixtures, is not to be <hi>Offended;</hi> but when a man himſelf diſpleaſes and offends God, and againſt his Duty.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is in <hi>the way of Righteouſneſs</hi> onely, that there is <hi>Life,</hi> and in <hi>the Path-way thereof,</hi> that there <hi>is no Death,</hi> none of the beginnings and firſt ſtrokes of it, of the avant Couriers of Death.

                  </p>
                  <p>But the ways of <hi>Scandal,</hi> ſo cloſely united with Sin, though they ſeem right in a Mans own Eyes, yet are all along <hi>the ways of Death,</hi> and moſt evidently ſo in <hi>their end.</hi>

He that <hi>hates his Brother,</hi> is ready to fall out with every thing that he is for, and knows not at what he ſtumbles, whether it be truly of God and Chriſt, or not, and ſo is no juſt occaſion of <hi>ſtumbling,</hi> though he <hi>ſtumble</hi> at it. <note place="margin">1 <hi>John.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Government and Authority God hath veſted in Conſcience to underſtand with God for it ſelf, and the Soul; and to guide it ſelf according to his Command, who is its only Father, and it ought to have none <hi>upon Earth,</hi> beſide him; even as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is its <hi>one Maſter,</hi> is a Grand Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of True Religion.</p>
                  <p>And this is of ſo great concernment, that though the thing be good a Man does, yet if he does it not upon a Judgement, a Senſe, a Dictate of Conſcience; or if that he refuſes be truly Evil, yet if it be not rejected in the ſame manner, upon the ſame Motives, neither the one nor the other ariſes to a Religious action, or is accepted with God, as done in <hi>his Fear,</hi> but is <hi>a vain honour</hi> of him.</p>
                  <p>Now to the diſcharge of Conſcience, in this its ſo high Office and Truſt it owes to it ſelf and the Soul, that it be richly and abundantly furniſhed with the knowledge of the Divine Will, and the <hi>Word of God dwelling</hi> in it; that ſeeing it is both the <hi>Scribe</hi> and <hi>Doctor,</hi> or, if I may ſo ſpeak, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of the Soul within it ſelf, it be as the <hi>good Houſeholder,</hi> that <hi>brings forth out of his Treaſury things new and old,</hi> that it attend to all Means of Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> entertain all Wiſdom,

                  </p>
                  <p>And that its influence may be powerful and effective upon the Soul, to all Holy and Heavenly Obedience, there muſt be a juſt preſervation of its Authority, and good Conduct, that ſo it may promote the Soul into all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, having gained a high Reputation and Honour, by the ſucceſs it hath had already, and the comfort and good expectation it raiſes within the Soul, upon its happy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: For the <hi>upright man,</hi> from this vigor of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>holds on his way,</hi> and grows <hi>ſtronger and ſtronger;</hi> and <note place="margin">

                     <hi>the way of the Juſt</hi> becomes <hi>as the ſhining Light, that ſhines more and more to the perfect day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore one of the principal <hi>Scandals</hi> Scripture remarques upon, is this, When Conſcience, upon any Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, upon any Inſinuation, or Uſurpation upon it, betrays this Truſt, and ſurrenders it ſelf to any other Dictate or Authority, but that which is Divine; and that ſhining within it ſelf, and ſo aſſuring it by its Rationality, Goodneſs, Purity, Majeſty, that it is from God: To take any thing upon truſt from Men, that it does not try, and examine, or to let go any thing it hath ſo tryed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and found good, upon any pretence whatever, is indeed to be <hi>Scandaliſed;</hi> that pretence, that does ſo aſſume over it, and prevail with it againſt it ſelf, Scandaliſes it.</p>
                  <p>For the charge of repreſenting to the Soul, the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Divine Laws, is committed to the Conſcience; the ſupream Moderation is in God, and the Divine Law; yet it is tranſmitted into the Soul, it enters thither through the Dictates of Conſcience; whatever then ſo impoſes on Conſcience, as that it recedes from its Government, Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daliſes it; for the Government of God is loſt alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65165:137"/>
                  <p> And though Conſcience cannot juſtifie a man in any error, nor ought to poſſeſs a Man with unneceſſary ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; yet ſtill the main Government of Conſcience deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it ſelf from God, and the true underſtanding of his Will, is by no means to be ſhaken.</p>
                  <p>For Man, as a Rational Creature, as a Creature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, cannot obey God, but by the Mediation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. He muſt know, and judge within himſelf, what is the Divine Law, and obey it. If he does in Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to that Will, and does not know it, it is not true Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe it is not Religious; it is not reaſonable, or rationally Religious Obedience.</p>
                  <p>The Obedience of God is ſeated in the Judgment, in the Conſcience; if theſe Reins are ſlack and looſe, if this Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bridle be neglected, Men know not whither they may run, upon what they may be driven, and never diſcover the danger. A man cannot diſtinguiſh what is from God, from what is not; if this guſt of the Soul be not quick, vigorouſly exerciſed, and left free.</p>
                  <p>Conſcience may be inſtructed, adviſed, perſwaded, yea, even menaced and terrified by the Applications of the Word of God to it; nay, it may be over-ruled by Lawful Authority, wherein it turns Apoſtate, or Renegade to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion; yet it can never be Lawfully depos'd, or put out of Authority: The Myſtery of Faith, the Rule of Obedience, the Conſolation and Vigor of the Soul, are all preſerved in a <hi>pure Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>Shipwracked</hi> together with it.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe Conſcience is placed by God in this great Truſt and Dignity; it becomes, and it muſt needs become ſo great a matter of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> diſcourſes: when Conſcience not duly regarding its own light, and inward Senſe ſurrenders it ſelf to a forreign Rule; ſteers it ſelf by a compaſs out of it ſelf; ſays, another ſhall be wiſe and ſee, and Dictate for it; and ſo gives up it ſelf in an implicite Faith, and blind Obedience.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65165:137"/>
                  <p> Here is <hi>Scandal</hi> in its Deluſive, Deceptive Power; a Man thinks it modeſt, cautious, a point of Honour and Subjection to thoſe that are above him, to be carried by an Authority out of himſelf: Conſcience hereupon deſerts its own Principles, and its own place in directing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them: Upon this it falls into all the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, the miſchief of <hi>Scandal.</hi> Conſcience is <hi>wounded, grieved, weakned,</hi> and lies <hi>proſtrate;</hi> and without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, the <hi>work of God</hi> in the Natural, or new Creation, is <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> and even the Man for whom <hi>Chriſt dyed</hi> periſhes.</p>
                  <p>God hath concredited the <hi>Keys</hi> of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> within the Soul to Conſcience alone; and I cannot find that it can be at all excuſed in reſigning them into any Hand, but his that gave them; no not to an <hi>Angel from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Miniſters of Religion, and Magiſtrates in their place, have theſe <hi>Keys,</hi> as they are Adminiſtred without a Man, to offer and preſs upon him all conſiderations of his Duty.</p>
                  <p>But every Man muſt ſee with his own Eyes, and not anothers for him, he muſt be enlightned by Beams and Rayes that ſhine within his own Soul: He hath a private double Look upon himſelf, and none may <hi>open</hi> and <hi>ſhut</hi> but Conſcience, in and with God: whoever elſe does, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Father,</hi> and a <hi>Maſter upon Earth</hi> to him, in the place of God and Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Upon this account the Apoſtle lays down theſe three <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22, 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> great Poſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>whatever is not of Faith,</hi> of a free and full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of Conſcience, <hi>is Sin.</hi> For though the Natures of things cannot be changed in themſelves; yet as we are converſant in them, it is an undoubted Rule, <hi>Bonum oritur ex integris cauſis.</hi> Every thing conſpires to, and concerts Good; but Evil being a declenſion and fall from Good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of fall or aberration from Good, is Evil; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65165:138"/> this Plenipotence of Conſcience, committed to it by God, is a prime neceſſary in every good thing, and the want of it greatly evil; though it hath not an Omnipotence of changing Nature it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From hence it follows, he that <hi>does,</hi> and doubts in what he <hi>does,</hi> is <hi>condemned</hi> in his <hi>doing</hi> (whatever the thing be in it ſelf) becauſe to him it is ſo far Evil, that he does it againſt that Domeſtick Authority of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He is a <hi>happy Man,</hi> that (eſpecially having fallen into doubt) in doubtful things is come to ſo good a Reſolution, <hi>as not to condemn himſelf</hi> in that wherein <hi>he allows himſelf.</hi> He that hath a good aſſurance riſing, neither from Ignorance nor Careleſneſs, is a <hi>happy Man;</hi> by way of Eminency. It is a rare and extraordinary <hi>happineſs,</hi> and he that hath not, but is perplexed with Doubt, ought not to be as a <hi>Lamp deſpiſed;</hi> he deſerves great tenderneſs and compaſſion: As I ſhall more fully have occaſion to obſerve under the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Head; <hi>viz. Scandal</hi> about <hi>Indifferent things;</hi> to which I now proceed.</p>
                  <p>And I am here to undertake a particular and diſtinct conſideration of <hi>Scandal;</hi> as it hath a moſt peculiar intereſt in thoſe ſo famous Debates of the Apoſtle, concerning <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things, Rom.</hi> 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. when they can any way be ſuppos'd to relate to God in the Notions of Religion, or have a preſence, how circumſtantial ſoever, in Divine Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon this undertaking, I muſt remove two Prejudices.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It muſt be acknowledged, <hi>Scandal</hi> in theſe caſes hath been indeed made Trivial, by ſome Mens injudicious Zeal, and ignorant dealing with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Senſe herein; who having a crude Conception of <hi>Scandal,</hi> from what he hath ſpoken of it, as a moſt formidable Evil, both in him that gives it, or takes it, have therefore called every
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65165:138"/> thing <hi>Scandal</hi> that diſpleaſes them; and mean nothing by being <hi>ſcandaliſed,</hi> but that they have greatly diſliked ſuch or ſuch things, without any other hazard of falling into ſin, than what is to be feared from their indiſcreet anger, and too often over-paſſionate Inflammation; whence hath riſen this <hi>Scandal,</hi> dangerous enough, That many are ready to believe, there is no ſuch thing as <hi>Scandal</hi> in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Things;</hi> except what <hi>unknowing Zeal</hi> in a ferment creates; or at leaſt have not taken into their thoughts this kind of true <hi>Scripture Scandal,</hi> or entertained a juſt fear of running into it, or enſnaring others in it.</p>
                  <p>But it will be evident to any one that duly weighs, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> proceeds upon much deeper and more grave Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. On the other ſide, the Fear of <hi>Scandal</hi> or <hi>ſcandaliſing</hi> hath been blown off by ſome, upon this miſtake, That Men can be in no danger to be <hi>ſcandaliſed,</hi> who keep far enough from being drawn by Example into any thing they diſlike, and are ſufficiently angry at: The Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſuch, they think, is a ſufficient Bar to them againſt <hi>Scandal,</hi> and againſt any ones being guilty, as an Author of <hi>Scandal</hi> to them, how hardly ſoever they preſs upon them; while they profeſs ſo loudly their Diſſent, they muſt not ſo much as name <hi>Scandal,</hi> without the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of groſs Ignorance.</p>
                  <p>But it is to be juſtly apprehended, a man may be <hi>He, by whom Scandal comes,</hi> though it find no place in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom it comes; as hath been already obſerved.</p>
                  <p>And further, Though the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath in theſe two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances fixed chiefly upon that ſort of <hi>Scandal,</hi> within which men are drawn by following Example againſt their inward Sentiments; yet, by a parity of Reaſon, <hi>Scandal</hi> is to be ſuſpected to have much larger compaſs, even in <hi>things of Indifferency,</hi> and lying farther off from mens doubtful complying in what they have Example or Command for,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65165:139"/> than that ſuch complyance ſhould be the only meaſure of <hi>Scandal</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>And even in thoſe that do comply with freer minds, there are more ſecret Paths and Tracks wherein <hi>Scandals</hi> are laid, than they generally and openly make complaint of, and that not only in regard of inward Doubts, but upon other accounts alſo.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore lay down theſe two Preparatories, to make theſe Diſcourſes of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> more concerning to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we have great Reaſon to be aſſured, they have their Foundation in the Denunciations of <hi>Woe</hi> by <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> upon <hi>the World</hi> becauſe of <hi>Scandal;</hi> upon him by whom <hi>Scandal comes,</hi> by way of tranſcendency; and his Admonition to all, that <hi>Scandals muſt needs come:</hi> For the ſame <hi>Divine Spirit of Truth</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Maſter</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and fram'd like Apprehenſions in him, when he ſpake afterward of the ſame point. Nay we have Reaſon to believe the latter Diſcourſe looks back upon the former, becauſe it was undoubtedly well known to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians then, and much more to the Apoſtle; who, beſides that he had <hi>immediate Revelations,</hi> moſt probably from the Lord, even of thoſe things that were written by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> gives proof he had a very peculiar care to know all He had ſpoken, and a ſingular reſpect to it; for he expreſly quotes our Saviour in thoſe immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, as in the Caſe of the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23. in what was written in the Evangeliſts, as in the Caſe of Divorce, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, in what he had attained, as well teſtified, though not recorded, as in that <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35. <hi>Remembring the words of the Lord Jeſus, It is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not therefore reaſonable to ſuppoſe, in ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of <hi>Scandal</hi> as theſe, he neglected ſo ſolemn a one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65165:139"/> as <hi>our Lords</hi> upon it. The <hi>Little ones</hi> in the Evangeliſt, and the <hi>Weak Brethren</hi> in the Apoſtle; the <hi>Wo</hi> in the one, and the <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the other; <hi>grieved, wounded, weak</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>ſtumbling, falling, periſhing,</hi> and being <hi>deſtroy'd,</hi> are of near affinity in their ſenſe: And thoſe even Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Occaſions of <hi>Scandal, It is good neither to eat Fleſh, nor drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak: If Meat make my Brother to offend, I will eat no Fleſh while the World ſtandeth,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>leſt I make my Brother to offend, or ſcandaliſe my Brother:</hi> Theſe ſo ſolemn Renunciations of Scandal are not far off from <hi>our Saviours Wo upon him by whom Scandal cometh:</hi> and that great <hi>Aphoriſm, Happy is he that condemneth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>

                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>in that thing which he alloweth,</hi> is grounded upon that; <hi>Scandals muſt needs come,</hi> they force an Entry at every the leaſt Advantage; and therefore, <hi>Happy is he</hi> that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſeeing the Inſtances of <hi>Scandal</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates upon, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Jewiſh diſtinction of Meats,</hi> and <hi>Eating things offered to Idols,</hi> were of a narrow and particular Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of a daily decreaſing Occurrence; the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſo laborious and induſtrious handling them being preſerv'd in Sacred Records, and tranſmitted down to after Ages, argues, he, or rather the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by him, deſigned to remonſtrate to the lateſt Poſterity of Chriſtians, the great Play, Scope, and Force of <hi>Scandal</hi> in theſe Indifferencies, and in all Caſes wherein they may fall out to be <hi>Scandals</hi> (though not after the Similitude of theſe) the danger of <hi>ſcandaliſing,</hi> or being <hi>ſcandaliſed.</hi>

                  </list>
                  <p>I begin with the firſt, the ſtating the Nature of <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> with relation to God, in theſe four Characters of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are things in themſelves Lawful, Innocent, and in their Uſe, as of themſelves, no way diſpleaſing to God. So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> pronounces, with great boldneſs and earneſtneſs, of <hi>Meats</hi> that were forbidden under the <hi>Law of Moſes: I am</hi> (ſaith he) in reſpect to them, <hi>perſwaded by the Lord Jeſus, there is nothing unclean of it ſelf, but all things are pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Caſe of <hi>Things offered to Idols,</hi> he declares, <hi>All things</hi> (viz. of that kind) <hi>are lawful,</hi> that is, with regard to the things themſelves, if they are uſed aright, if they are taken by the right Handle.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Meats</hi> have been <hi>offered to Idols,</hi> yet there is no ſuch thing as an <hi>Infinite Evil,</hi> that can taint <hi>what God hath made good. There is one God, the Father, of whom all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>things are</hi> originally, <hi>and we in him, and for him;</hi> and <hi>in</hi> or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65165:140"/> 
                     <hi>for</hi> no <hi>Idol</hi> or <hi>Demon: There is one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, by whom,</hi> in a reconciled and attoned State, <hi>after the great Corruption and Curſe by Sin, are all things, and we by him,</hi> and by no <hi>Demon-Mediator</hi> or <hi>Interceſſor.</hi> This Right, Title, Claim, and Propriety of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no <hi>Demon</hi> can expulſe. God and Chriſt <hi>ſo fill all things,</hi> that an <hi>Idol</hi> can be but a <hi>Nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe <hi>Indifferents,</hi> or the Uſe of them, cannot <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God,</hi> as of themſelves: we are <hi>not the better if we eat, or the worſe if we eat not; Meat commendeth us not to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There may yet be ſo Religious and Advantageous Uſe of them, as that they may, by the obſervation of all due Circumſtances, and the elevation of them to the beſt and worthieſt Ends, be <hi>Occaſions</hi> (I ſay, <hi>Occaſions</hi> onely) of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Service, and Glory to God, and that on either ſide; which ſhews their Indifferency; for one ſide may be made an occaſion of Religious Action, as well as the other; and ſo neither ſide obliges us more than other: <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, and giveth God thanks; He that eateth not to the Lord, he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. He that eateth Meat offered to Idols,</hi> in <hi>Gods Right,</hi> and not in <hi>the Right of the Demon,</hi> is a Partaker by <hi>Grace;</hi> or Divine Bounty, through Chriſt. For, the Meat is Gods, and his Proviſion; and the <hi>Idol,</hi> to him that underſtands, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it; and therefore he <hi>giveth God thanks,</hi> and not <hi>the Idol.</hi> It is in relation to theſe things, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commands, <hi>Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do,</hi> (that is, or <hi>not eat,</hi> or <hi>not drink) do all to the Glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. They may be uſed amiſs both ways. In ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, <hi>It is good not to eat Fleſh, or drink Wine, even while the World ſtandeth.</hi> They may in ſome Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>be inexpedients,</hi> and <hi>not edifie;</hi> that is, by a diminutive way of ſpeaking, run counter to the Ends of <hi>Edification;</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65165:141"/> and <hi>Scandaliſe</hi> others. They that have knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their true nature, and the beſt uſe of them, may yet ſo uſe them, as <hi>to ſin againſt the Brethren,</hi> and <hi>wound their righteous Conſcience,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſin againſt Chriſt.</hi> But they that Eat <hi>without knowledge,</hi> Eat ſo as <hi>to Eat with Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> to <hi>doubt,</hi> and <hi>be damned in their Eating.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the the other ſide, they which uſe them not, that <hi>Eat not,</hi> that <hi>will not Eat,</hi> may ſo not Eat, as to turn them into another ſort of <hi>Scandal,</hi> while they grow ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly affraid to <hi>touch, taſte,</hi> or <hi>handle;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that uſeth <hi>Indefferent things</hi> aright, only makes uſe of that ſide of them he chooſes, as an occaſion or acting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> as he deſires to do in all he does, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out placing any weight on either ſide of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian <hi>fully perſwaded in his own mind to eat eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and giveth God thanks;</hi> but knows <hi>meat commends him not to God,</hi> makes it no matter of Religion <hi>to eat,</hi> and ſo in caſe of <hi>Scandal</hi> forbears it. The Chriſtian that <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not,</hi> maketh uſe of the liberty he hath, as in <hi>an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent thing, not to eat</hi> either <hi>meats unclean</hi> according to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or things <hi>offered to Idols;</hi> without laying any ſtreſs of Religion upon his abſtinence in either, but only the aſſurance he is not the worſe in not eating, and thereby avoiding the inconvenience of either doubting in himſelf, or <hi>ſcandaliſing</hi> any other: In the ſame manner he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of his liberty in <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> upon any good occaſion, that was diſtinguiſhed under <hi>the Law,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>obſerving of Days</hi> as a point of Religion, but only places a Religious Action on that <hi>Day,</hi> according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty he hath in an <hi>indifferent thing:</hi> And ſo avoids the Doubt in himſelf of not obſerving what is Commanded, and the <hi>ſcandal</hi> to any other.</p>
                  <p>But now he that <hi>not eating</hi> ſlips unawares into a ſurmiſe of Evil in the things themſelves, and that he does a great
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65165:141"/> act of Religion in <hi>not eating,</hi> and ſo dares not <hi>touch, taſte, handle;</hi> or he that would gain, as he thinks, upon God by <hi>obſerving Days,</hi> he falls into the <hi>Scandal</hi> of making his Weakneſs a part of his Religion; even as he that for the vaunt of his liberty eats licentiouſly, and careleſly of others; or thinks in <hi>eating</hi> he does God ſervice: or in <hi>eating</hi> ſlides into his old awes or pangs of Devotion to the <hi>Idol,</hi> and <hi>eats</hi> in his Right, to his Honour, and ſo is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed: or laſtly, <hi>eats</hi> when he is in doubt of the lawfulneſs, upon the credit of Example, which is the proper <hi>Scandal</hi> the Apoſtle aims at.</p>
                  <p>Now from all theſe Characters it is moſt evident,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Indifferent Things</hi> are far below the Scale of Divine Inſtitutions, though theſe Inſtitutions are but Poſitive, and not of Eternal Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>All the Appointments of God and Chriſt are lifted up into that ſtate the Divine Appointment deſigns them to; and ſhall, if uſed according to thoſe Appointments, be made efficacious to thoſe Ends for which they are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to the effectual working of that Power and Grace from which they received their Original: So that they do <hi>make us better,</hi> they do <hi>commend us to God,</hi> if we obſerve the Will and Law of God concerning them; and <hi>we are the worſe</hi> in the ſinful neglect of them, according to the degree of neglect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are not of the Scale of thoſe things, wherein that Order, of which God, by the very laws of Rational Nature is the Author, ſtands; and not of <hi>Confuſion;</hi> ſo that though this Order runs, or ought to run along, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct all Humane Actions, and ſo is not in it ſelf a point of Religion; yet when it is applyed to Religious Services and Actions, doth indeed commend our Religious Actions and Services to God, and the contrary is an Evil.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:65165:142"/> 3. Of the ſame account is that <hi>Euſchemonia,</hi> or Decency of Religious Actions, required by God before himſelf, and before the <hi>Holy Angels,</hi> of which the Apoſtle diſcourſes; <hi>Every man praying with his Head uncoverd, diſhonoureth his Head;</hi> every Woman praying ſo, ought to have a <hi>covering on her Head, becauſe of the Angels;</hi> ſuch a diſtinction of Sexes being founded in Nature; and in what is beyond Nature, the grave Cuſtoms of Ages and Places, carry a great weight of Determination.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The moſt <hi>indifferent Circumſtances,</hi> that yet moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily attend all ſerious, and important humane Actions, (and therefore Religious Actions) when once determined, by the Prudence and mature conſideration of thoſe that have greateſt right to determine therein, as Times, Places, and general Order of Publick Worſhip, become (however <hi>indifferent</hi> in themſelves) yet above <hi>indifferent</hi> in their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; becauſe the undue change of them is not only Levity, but approaches to Frenzy.</p>
                  <p>And now I have ſo far ſettled the Nature of <hi>Indifferents,</hi> that I think no variety of Circumſtances can make an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in any, more than in thoſe Eternal Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of things. I come therefore to the Second thing in the Platform I have given of the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To inquire how <hi>Scandal</hi> invades theſe ſo innocent <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencies,</hi> when they come into a Relation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>And the very ground or advantage of its entry, is through this very Relation to Religion. For therein is the very Center of <hi>Scandal,</hi> as a Corruption of the beſt thing; there is its great Power and Sting, to diſorder the ſtate of things betwixt God and Man; and the more any thing comes into that conſideration, the more efficacious is <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> upon it, if not warily prevented.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:65165:142"/>
                  <p> And it is therefore the moſt Chriſtian Policie, to leave all things without the <hi>Line of Religion,</hi> or <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> that can be ſpared, and are not of neceſſary uſe to it, to cut off all broad <hi>Phylacteries,</hi> on that very account, that Scandal is ſo attempting, and invading, and nothing ſafe from its Aſſaults; even as indefenſible Buildings in a Garriſon are pulled down and ſlighted, leſt the Enemy make advantage of them to cover himſelf. Incumbring Religion with <hi>Indifferents,</hi> more than needs muſt, are but ſo many Shelters for <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scandal</hi> then, in <hi>Indifferent things</hi> pertaining to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is an Occaſion taken upon them, as they ſtand in that Relation, to act, under ſome pretence, contrary to any of the great Principles or Laws of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things are brought into a Relation to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By ſome Appointment of God, who alone hath Right to do it, exalting Indifferent Things into a Goodneſs above their Nature, or for wiſe Purpoſes depreſſing them below their Nature; which Appointment ceaſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, they return each of them into their own natural <hi>Indifferency,</hi> and are alike <hi>good</hi> and <hi>clean;</hi> and upon the juſt Level of their firſt Creation, of themſelves are nothing to Religion, eſpecially as it is perfected in Chriſtianity. This was the Caſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> treats upon to the <hi>Romans:</hi> There was a Law of God by <hi>Moſes,</hi> diſtinguiſhing <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Meats;</hi> this Law was out dated by Chriſt; all things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returned into their original State of equal Goodneſs and Cleanneſs, and were wholly alike, as to any Religious Account of them, to all that underſtood the aboliſhing of that Law, which at that time was but beginning.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Indifferents</hi> are brought into a Relation to Religion, by Mans Idolatrous or Superſtitious Tranſmutation of them out of their Natures, either above or below them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which being greatly abominable to God, as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65165:143"/> to his ſole Right, and very deſtructive to Mans Soul, debauches theſe Indifferents into great Impurity, to all that with Deſign and Reſolution will underſtand and uſe them ſo changed: To them that are <hi>unbelieving and defiled</hi> is <hi>nothing pure, but even their Mind and Conſcience is defiled.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15.</note> But being underſtood aright, and according to their Nature, they return to their own Innocency and Purity, that is, the Purity of their Creation, and Diſpoſition by God, <hi>(for to the pure all things are pure)</hi> and to an Indifferency every way, in relation to Religion.</p>
                  <p>This was the Caſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> reaſons upon to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Meats offered to Idols, the Idols Temple,</hi> were moſt impure to the <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and Superſtitions:</p>
                  <p>Yet the <hi>Idol</hi> could not expulſe God's Right, nor change the Nature of his Creation.</p>
                  <p>This was moſt amply declared in the Goſpel-ſtate of Things.</p>
                  <p>They that underſtood this, had a moſt Lawful and Free Uſe of thoſe very <hi>Places,</hi> and <hi>Meats,</hi> that were ſo polluted by the Gentiles: So that whether <hi>they eat, or not eat,</hi> it was all alike, in the things themſelves, upon any Religious account.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Indifferent Things</hi> may be made Appurtenances to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without being extravaſated from their own Nature of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> by being put by the Authority of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, or Civil Rulers, into a conſtant Concomitancy or Attendance upon ſuch or ſuch Religious Services, ſolely upon the account of that Humane Significancy, Decency, and Order the Nature of Man is apt to clothe all its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with. Juſt as in all Inſtalments of Magiſtrates, in Courts of Judicature, in Proceedings of Juſtice, in all the Grandeur of Humane Actions, there are ſome Rites, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, or Ceremonies, Men find out, that give Order, Life, and Grace to the Carriage of them: Even ſo in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65165:143"/> Services it is ſuppos'd they have the ſame Liberty; God is not ſo rigorous, as to deny it to them; they may appoint ſome things of a meer <hi>Humane Significancy,</hi> for <hi>Edification,</hi> which remain ſtill perfect <hi>Indifferents,</hi> and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait upon Religion, and preſerve <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> and yet they may be impos'd, and pinn'd ſo faſt to Religion, that All muſt be obſerv'd together; no Publick Ordinance may be enjoy'd, with Allowance and Approbation, without them.</p>
                  <p>Now whether there is ſuch a Liberty granted by God to Men, to adjoyn any thing to his Worſhip, eſpecially ſo as to be made the Publick Standard, is more than the wiſeſt can, I doubt, reſolve in the Affirmative, to ſatisfaction: There are ſo many Appearances from Scripture, from ſound Reaſon, againſt any more than is commanded by God himſelf, or is of abſolute Neceſſity, Order, or Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo as to offer it ſelf to every ſober Man.</p>
                  <p>But allow to theſe Inſtitutions of Men all the Privileges of <hi>Indifferents,</hi> of theſe <hi>ſeal'd Indifferents,</hi> declar'd ſo by the Apoſtle, ſo that you allow no more; (for more can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be allow'd, except you change them into <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which makes them worſe:) Allow, that they are <hi>the weak,</hi> who do not underſtand their full Freedom herein; then it follows, He that uſes them not, muſt not indeed think himſelf the better for not uſing them; but ſtill he has liberty, as in a thing <hi>indifferent</hi> in it ſelf, not to uſe them; and he ought by no means to uſe them <hi>with doubt,</hi> and ſo long as they appear unlawful to him; for then comes upon him that Thunderbolt of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> If he <hi>doubts,</hi> and yet does what he doubts of, he is <hi>condemned; becauſe whatever is not of Faith, is Sin.</hi> He that is <hi>fully perſwaded in his own mind</hi> to uſe them, may uſe them; and they ought to appear of that Value to him, that he can <hi>give God thanks</hi> for them <hi>with underſtanding;</hi> for that is one Character of the <hi>Apoſtles Indifferents,</hi> and a ſevere Teſt upon them it is.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65165:144"/>
                  <p> But yet he muſt not think himſelf <hi>the better</hi> for them, or that ſuch things can <hi>commend him to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He muſt not uſe them to the <hi>ſcandaliſing</hi> the <hi>weaker</hi> than himſelf, even while the <hi>World ſtandeth;</hi> that is, while the Reaſon of Doubt can in the Nature of that Reaſon remain.</p>
                  <p>And he muſt allow, that his <hi>Indifferents</hi> are as ſubject to <hi>Scandal,</hi> as the <hi>Indifferents</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> diſcourſes upon are; and if the very reaſonably-to be-ſuppos'd <hi>Scandal</hi> in theſe (of themſelves) ſo harmleſs <hi>Indifferents,</hi> be well conſider'd, I doubt there will be found a great and wide Sea for this <hi>Leviathan</hi> to roll it ſelf in. Now that I may make this Conſideration more orderly, I ſhall diſtribute it according to the ſeveral Ranges of Perſons concern'd, and endanger'd by <hi>Scandal</hi> in theſe <hi>Indifferents.</hi> And I begin with</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thoſe that comply with that ſide of them which the <hi>Strongeſt</hi> chuſe, that is, the Uſe of them; becauſe this is immediately under the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Eye: I ſay, that comply, but are <hi>not fully perſwaded in their own mind.</hi> Now the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> imputes their Compliance to the Power of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is the freeſt ſort of Compliance: For, though he had taken notice of <hi>Deſpiſings</hi> in the former part of the Diſcourſe, yet he waves that; Impoſitions by Church-Cenſures, or Penalties, were quite out of his Thoughts; he arreſts them upon Example, the moſt ingenuous ſort of Compulſion, and ſubmitting to it the moſt ſpontaneous Conformity: Yet both to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the <hi>Corinths,</hi> here he places the danger of <hi>ſcandaliſing</hi> and <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thy <hi>Brother</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be grieved with thy Meat,</hi> that is, <hi>not grieved</hi> that thou <hi>eateſt,</hi> but drawn to <hi>eat,</hi> as thou doſt, yet not perſwaded, as thou art, and ſo receiving a real Wound and Grief in his Conſcience, by following thy Example, <hi>thou walkeſt not charitably.</hi> More expreſly to this purpoſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> If any Man <hi>ſee thee, which haſt knowledge,</hi> ſit at <hi>Meat</hi> in an <hi>Idols Temple, ſhall not the Conſcience of him that is weak be edified</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:65165:144"/> 
                     <hi>to eat thoſe things which are offered to Idols?</hi> Thus evident it is, Example is that which the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the very words points to. Now in that he lays this ſort of <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſing</hi> ſo low as in Example, he plants his Argument with greater force againſt any other Way, that is more forcible than Example. Here then is the <hi>Scandal,</hi> as given. The <hi>Scandal</hi> taken, is the ruſhing againſt that Principle of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, That the <hi>full ſenſe of a Mans own Mind,</hi> and what is to him of <hi>Faith,</hi> is in <hi>Indifferent Things</hi> the Square of his Actions; and the contrary is Sin, and <hi>Scandal.</hi> This is moſt evident in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans;</hi> his whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe runs into this, as the <hi>Scandal</hi> he intends to ſpeak of. To the <hi>Corinths</hi> it may be more Diſpute where the <hi>Scandal</hi> lay, becauſe the Sin ſeems to be a Relapſe into <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous eating, in an Idols Temple, the Meats offered to Idols:</hi> And that Expreſſion, <hi>of eating with Conſcience of the Idol, things offered to Idols, as offered to Idols,</hi> is at the firſt view almoſt enforcive of that Senſe; but by cloſer attention, it appears much otherwiſe: For, I obſerve, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> upon the occaſion diſcourſes firſt the Caſe it ſelf, in the eighth Chapter: In Chap. 9. in a Figure transferred to himſelf, he treats the neceſſary Retreat from our own Liberty in ſome Caſes, as a motive to all Chriſtians to do the ſame. In the tenth Chapter he diſcourſes the great danger of <hi>Idolatry it ſelf,</hi> which might be drawn as a Snare upon both <hi>the weak,</hi> and <hi>the ſtrong,</hi> by often Converſe with <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and their Rites; and the intolerable Guilt and Danger of that, made forcible by ſeveral Arguments; and then towards the end of that Chapter, reſumes the plain Caſe of the <hi>weak,</hi> who not underſtanding Gods ſuperiour ſurmounting Right, over the <hi>Idols,</hi> conſider'd only the great evil of eating <hi>in honour to the Idol,</hi> and believed the <hi>Meat</hi> and the <hi>Temple</hi> irrecoverably <hi>defiled</hi> by it: They had not the <hi>knowledge,</hi> that an <hi>Idol</hi> was <hi>nothing,</hi> and therefore could not affect things themſelves, to all that keep themſelves <hi>pure,</hi> and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65165:145"/> 
                     <hi>know</hi> that Gods Right overcomes, and his filling all things excludes all others, and their Right becomes a Nothing. But <hi>ſome not having this knowledge, eat in a Temple Meats</hi> that had the <hi>Idols Superſcription</hi> and <hi>Image upon them</hi> (as they thought) not in any <hi>Honour to the Idol,</hi> but tyded along by Example to communicate in what they yet eſteemed <hi>defiled</hi> and <hi>polluted,</hi> though indeed it was not ſo, but to thoſe that <hi>eſteemed</hi> it ſo. This Point the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> plainly enters upon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 23. going off from that of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> in theſe Words, <hi>All things are lawful, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 28. he thus opens what he intends; If any Man, as in a fright at ſo hainous a thing, as eating the defiled <hi>Meat,</hi> that had been conſecrate to an <hi>Idol, ſay unto you, This is offered in Sacrifice to Idols, eat not for his ſake that ſhewed it,</hi> and for <hi>his Conſcience-ſake, not thy own,</hi> that was ſcar'd at it, as if unclean in it ſelf, and yet might be drawn to <hi>eat it,</hi> as ſuch, by thy Example, not <hi>Idolatrouſly,</hi> but with a <hi>doubting Conſcience.</hi> And the very ſame Reaſon, why out of this Caſe of anothers Scandal, a Man might eat, even becauſe <hi>the Earth is the Lords,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſs of it,</hi> his Right cannot be retrench'd, nothing can be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean in it ſelf that is Gods; the very ſame is given for <hi>not eating,</hi> in caſe of <hi>Scandal, The Earth is the Lords,</hi> and <hi>the fulneſs of it;</hi> that is, We are not tied up to one Thing, to aſſert Gods Right in that only, that we muſt needs run <hi>our Brother into Scandal</hi> for it: <hi>The Earth,</hi> that has room enough; and the <hi>Fulneſs of it,</hi> a full Table (beſides that ſuppos'd to be the Idols) is the <hi>Lords,</hi> and his Bounty to be enjoyed in all, acknowledged, praiſed in all; ſo that we may <hi>pleaſe All,</hi> that is, conſult their trueſt Good, and <hi>give no Scandal;</hi> for that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means by <hi>pleaſing,</hi> and oppoſes it to <hi>grieving</hi> and <hi>wounding.</hi> Thus large I have been in bringing the Caſe to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to theſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> to much the ſame level and pitch, (except the Meats be ſuſpected fouler by Dedication to an Idol, than
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65165:145"/> by the meer <hi>Moſaick</hi> Interdict) that the main Point of <hi>Scandal</hi> might be ſetled. For, though I ſhall allow juſt Conſideration to all other Points of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and to the other Interpretation, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtle diſcourſes againſt thoſe <hi>Idolatrous Contaminations</hi> thoſe Pangs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and <hi>Reverence of the Idol,</hi> the tender new-conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Chriſtian might relapſe into, by <hi>eating in the Idols Temple, at the Idols Feaſt;</hi> yet the main Point is, <hi>eating with offence,</hi> with a <hi>Conſcience</hi> not ſatisfied, the <hi>Meats</hi> that were pure in themſelves, but to them appeared impure; as is evident by the much different ſharpneſs of Style the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> uſes in the danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and the Caſe of the <hi>Doubting Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The immediate Principle <hi>offended</hi> againſt, is then, The Government Conſcience ought to have over Man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it by God, againſt which nothing Humane ought to prevail, nor can do, but with the great miſchief of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this, there is ſome other Rule, or Principle of Truth, guiding Conſcience, and preſſing upon it in caſe of <hi>Scandal;</hi> for Conſcience is not to guide a Man, but as it repreſents to him ſome Truth, to guide it ſelf and him by: elſe, as when the <hi>Blind lead the Blind,</hi> both will <hi>fall into the Ditch.</hi> And when this Principle, that preſſes hard upon Conſcience, and to which Conſcience defers it ſelf, is over-born, then a Man is <hi>ſcandaliſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Principle, Conſcience, in the Caſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> had lying hard upon it, was this:</p>
                  <p>Whatever God hath forbidden once, <hi>as unclean,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and is ſo long unclean, till we know that Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is removed. The <hi>weak Chriſtian</hi> did not believe the forbidding ſome Meats as <hi>unclean,</hi> was removed; yet by the countenance of Example in the ſtronger Chriſtians, they were ſo hardy as to <hi>eat,</hi> while <hi>Conſcience was unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> and ſo were <hi>ſcandaliſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:65165:146"/>
                  <p> 
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> in the <hi>Corinths</hi> had this Principle looking it full in the Face; To <hi>eat in an Idols Right,</hi> in <hi>Honour to Idols,</hi> is an abomination to God. The weak Chriſtian abhorring <hi>Idols,</hi> or to <hi>eat in Honour of them,</hi> did not as yet underſtand there could be a Separation betwixt the Pollution of the <hi>Idol,</hi> and the <hi>Meat,</hi> or the <hi>Temple</hi> where he was worſhipped: yet emboldned by ſeeing the <hi>ſtronger ſit at Meat in an Idols Temple,</hi> they <hi>eat,</hi> and were inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted at the unclean Meat they <hi>eat;</hi> they <hi>eat with Conſcience of the Idol,</hi> the <hi>Meat as offered to the Idol,</hi> through the force of Example; that is, abhorring indeed <hi>the Idol,</hi> and his <hi>Meat;</hi> but withal, fearing it, as an Evil, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Meat as impure, becauſe <hi>ſacrificed to an Idol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In both theſe Caſes the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> levels againſt the uſe <hi>of Liberty in the ſtronger,</hi> againſt impoſing by way of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to the <hi>ſcandal</hi> of the <hi>weaker;</hi> ſo tender a thing it is to offer but the <hi>Loweſt Rule</hi> of Compulſion in theſe Caſes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Impoſer</hi> then, though but by Example, is he that <hi>ſcandaliſes:</hi> The Complier againſt the Senſe of his own Mind, inſtructed not by Truth and Reaſon ſatisfying him, but by Example leading him, is the <hi>Scandaliſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Things being thus ſtated, let us obſerve the <hi>Scandal</hi> it ſelf, how it works in this Caſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is an Act of high Diſobedience committed againſt God, and his Authority, repreſented by Conſcience; both in that Conſcience, deputed by God, is depoſed, and Example ſet up in its place; as alſo that a Divine Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſcience it ſelf, ſuppoſed to continue in force, is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; for though it ſhould be indeed antiquated, yet if Conſcience knows not it is ſo, it cannot act <hi>of Faith</hi> and <hi>full perſwaſion,</hi> and ſo ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſcience is hereupon <hi>grieved, wounded,</hi> and loſes its due Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This begets a Flatneſs and Formality in all Religious Services.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65165:146"/> 4. A Lukewarmneſs to Religion in general; thus a Man is <hi>weakned</hi> by his <hi>Stumble</hi> and <hi>Fall,</hi> he lies proſtrate in all Religious Powers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Conſcience</hi> loſes its due vigour and exerciſe of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is danger of <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf, or the true Senſe of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Hereupon the Soul is in danger to be loſt, and the <hi>work of God to be deſtroyed,</hi> and he <hi>for whom Chriſt died, to periſh,</hi> if not recovered by Repentance. Thus it was with the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Corinths.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to bring this to the Balance with Impoſitions in <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or <hi>Indifferents,</hi> in after-Times. Firſt, Suppoſe the Sentiments of the Mind and Conſcience of many <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> deeply ingag'd, and lock'd in this Principle, That in the Worſhip of God, no Man may <hi>add,</hi> or <hi>diminiſh,</hi> ſo much as to a Point, beyond Divine Inſtitution, and the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Circumſtances, and neceſſary Adherencies of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Grave Humane Actions: That there muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Humane Device, for Edification or Significancy, but what is preſcrib'd. And no Man can deny, but this is a ſafe Poſition, conſidering both the Stream of Scripture, ſound Reaſon, and the Experience of all Ages, how much miſchief hath come ſtealing up from Ceremonies, as high as to Idolatry and Superſtition.</p>
                  <p>But let us withal allow, That though no Man can be the <hi>better</hi> for uſing theſe <hi>Indifferents,</hi> nor the <hi>worſe</hi> for not uſing them; yet there is a Liberty to <hi>uſe them,</hi> without being the <hi>worſe</hi> for uſing them, if a Man be <hi>fully perſuaded in his own mind</hi> concerning them. It muſt remain yet, that according to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Doctrine, every Man that <hi>uſes</hi> them, and <hi>doubts</hi> of their lawfulneſs with reſpect to the forenamed Principle, is <hi>condemned</hi> in the uſing them, becauſe <hi>not of Faith,</hi> and ſo ſubject to all the juſt-now-recounted Miſchiefs of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65165:147"/>
                  <p> And that therefore, He that uſes them ſo as to preſs thoſe that are <hi>otherwiſe minded,</hi> to a Conformity, by his Example (if it be no more), much more if by <hi>Deſpiſings,</hi> Cenſures, Vexations, Penalties; he does not <hi>walk charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> he <hi>ſins againſt Chriſtians, wounds their weak Conſciences,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſins againſt Chriſt</hi> in a high Degree; and for his Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the <hi>work of God is deſtroyed,</hi> and he <hi>for whom Chriſt died periſhes,</hi> if not ſav'd by Repentance. Now how high does this riſe up to the <hi>Woe Chriſt denounces on him by whom Scandals come?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For, it cannot but be ſuppos'd, there are many that are wrought upon, againſt the ſenſe of their own Minds, to ſuch a Conformity, as wherein they cannot but <hi>condemn themſelves</hi> wherein they ſeem <hi>to allow themſelves,</hi> or do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>allow themſelves,</hi> ſo far as the outward Act reaches: Who can doubt, but in theſe days there are ſuch, as well as in the Days of the firſt Chriſtians? Yea, <hi>happy</hi> are many of thoſe that Conform, if they do not <hi>condemn themſelves wherein they allow themſelves,</hi> and carry the Miſchief of their <hi>Scandal</hi> within themſelves, ſilently from others, and often ſecretly from themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And even where Men ſtand out againſt all preſſure upon them, and will not receive this Dint of <hi>Scandal,</hi> yet it is ſtill a <hi>Scandal</hi> offered, while unaccepted.</p>
                  <p>All this now ſeems ſo ſtrong againſt impoſing in things of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> for fear of <hi>Scandal</hi> in them, that it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there ſhould be any Impoſition known in ſuch things among <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for fear of <hi>Scandal;</hi> and yet in theſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things of <hi>Indifferency, Scandal</hi> hath run like Wild-fire, bluſter'd and roar'd like a Tempeſt, in theſe of all things, to chuſe, and that in all Ages within the Chriſtian World, and even under <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to conſider <hi>Scandal</hi> in a ſecond Rank, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe who do vehemently and zealouſly fall in with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to theſe Impoſitions in <hi>Indifferents,</hi> yet they may
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65165:147"/> be <hi>ſcandaliſed,</hi> and that very deeply. This Caſe does not, I confeſs, ariſe out of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Diſcourſes, except by the other Interpretation of the Scope of that to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths;</hi> which gives it not onely, as if Compliance againſt the Sentiments of Conſcience, upon the Truſt of Example, were the Sin and <hi>Scandal;</hi> but that the <hi>weaker Chriſtians,</hi> not having the Knowledge of the <hi>ſtronger,</hi> doing as they did, and not prepoſſeſs'd as they were, that the <hi>Idol</hi> was nothing, ſunk into ſome Degrees at leaſt of <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Worſhip, as if they knew no other Reaſon of <hi>eating in an Idols Temple,</hi> but Devotion to him: And this kind of <hi>Scandal,</hi> though I believe the drift of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> is chiefly as I have explained it, yet too often falls out in theſe Caſes. Thoſe Ceremonies that have been promoted into Divine Services, or into the Ornament of Religion, and the Places of it, have been, though dangerouſly enough, yet not ſo ill deſign'd, as afterwards abuſed by more Ignorant Perſons, who greedy and fond of a ſenſual and external Religion, have been tranſported upon <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi> and ſometimes downright <hi>Idolatry;</hi> and this often noted in Scripture under the very Name of <hi>Scandal.</hi> Thus I before obſerv'd in the Caſe of <hi>Gideons Ephod, his Houſe and all Iſrael</hi> were <hi>inſnar'd</hi> beyond the firſt Intention: Thus in the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> continued (no doubt) in memory of the Miracle; yet afterwards prov'd ſo great a <hi>Snare,</hi> that they <hi>burnt Incenſe to it.</hi> And it is moſt likely, <hi>Balaam caſt his Snare</hi> at firſt in a leſs-guilty Feaſting with the <hi>Midia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> upon their <hi>Idols Sacrifices,</hi> not known to be ſuch poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Meat, and by degrees toll'd them on into the midſt of the <hi>Congregation</hi> and <hi>Aſſembly of Idolaters.</hi> Thus the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by Divine Direction, condeſcending to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Convert-Jews among the <hi>Romans,</hi> on conſideration of the Divine Command in ſome of their Rites but juſt now expiring, degenerated afterward into ſuch a <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> that the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> was moſt ſevere againſt it; and that very
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65165:148"/> 
                     <hi>Strength</hi> of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Chriſtians, or at leaſt the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Unknowing, following their Example, became afterwards into an infamous Doctrine, <hi>the Doctrine of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam,</hi> and the very inchanting Seduction of the <hi>Propheteſs Jezebel, who taught the People of Chriſt to commit Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to eat things offered to Idols,</hi> in honour to them. The bringing in of Pictures into Places of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſuppoſe it as innocent as could be ſuppos'd at firſt, yet was abus'd ſpeedily into all imaginable Corruption; and it is much to be fear'd, all the Remonſtrances concerning more Innocent Rites, as they can't vindicate them from Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſity on one ſide, ſo can't preſerve them from Mens placing too much of their Religion in them on the other, whereby the true <hi>Conſcience</hi> of it is weakned, the Vertue and Vigour of Conſcience in things truly Religious, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ſpent, by having been laid out unneceſſarily upon extern Obſervances; and looſneſs of Life, like <hi>Fornication with eating things offered to Idols,</hi> breaking in upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute of ſuch Flatteries of <hi>Conſcience</hi> for ſubſtantial Piety, as the <hi>Jews</hi> would exchange <hi>New-Moons</hi> and <hi>Oblations,</hi> for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>walking humbly with God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt be indeed acknowledg'd, not onely Humane Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, but even Divine Commands, are ſubject to the Injury of <hi>Scandal;</hi> but with this difference: One can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be cut off, though <hi>Scandal</hi> preſſes never ſo hard; the other may, and ought: For, in all things not ordained by God, the Principle ſinned againſt in <hi>Scandal</hi> is the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Purity of Religion, the ſubſtantial Piety, and moſt Spiritual and Rational Worſhip of himſelf God requires and expects by his Word; and that all things he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded be adjuſted to thoſe Ends, even as he provided them; and all he has not commanded, ſhould ſtand off, or at leaſt be preſently ſuperſeded, when become the Prey of <hi>Scandal.</hi> Yet on the other ſide, <hi>Scandal</hi> ſhelters it ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Order, Decency, or Edification of the Ignorant, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65165:148"/> to Authority; and preſſes on to the utmoſt under them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third ſort of <hi>Scandal</hi> ariſing from Indifferent Things, upon thoſe that will not be at all perſwaded to a Compliance with them; even they may be <hi>ſcandaliſed,</hi> by unlawful and very ſinful Cenſoriouſneſs, and Paſſion; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing too much of their ſenſe of Religion upon their diſlike of ſuch Additions to Divine Worſhip; Diviſions and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations on both ſides from the Publickeſt Worſhip of God, and National Union in Religion, beyond the Merit and Quality of the Cauſe, or further than the Caſe at its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent can require; and if the Sin of <hi>Schiſm</hi> be ſuch, as the endeavour'd Notion of it would make it, a Fall into the great Sin of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Principle offended againſt in this ſort of <hi>Scandal,</hi> is, That great <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſtians, and Union in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in Truth, and Peace, made ſo Fundamental in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pretence of <hi>Scandal</hi> lies too both ways, That for the ſake of ſuch Additionals, we may deſert thoſe much higher Conſiderations, and Reaſons, and Cauſes of <hi>Love</hi> and Union, and our Obligations to them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> repreſents this great Miſchief, not under the formal Account of <hi>Scandal,</hi> in the Diſcourſe to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> though I doubt not he after refers to it expreſly as ſuch, when he joyns <hi>Scandals</hi> and <hi>Diviſions</hi> together; but <note place="margin">

                  <p>And this is certain, The more excellent our Religion, the more deſirable our Publick Worſhip and Communion, for the Piety, Rationality, and Order of it, the more pure our <hi>National Church,</hi> and Aſſociation in Religion is, and the greater the Sin of <hi>Separation;</hi> the more does the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles

                  <p>For, how can it but appear Prodigie, and Portent, that Chriſtian Religion, that counted upon nothing but Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it ſelf in the World, ſhould turn the Weapons uſed againſt it, upon it ſelf; as hath been moſt notoriouſly infamous in the Popiſh Inhumanities? Or what Stranger can think well of ſuch a Chriſtianity? And then more dire it is, that <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> branding <hi>Popery</hi> as a Religion of Blood, ſhoud be ſo much as tinctur'd with any of <hi>that Spirit;</hi> and that any of theſe Evils ſhould be for the ſake, and upon the account of <hi>Indifferents,</hi> that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be <hi>deviſed by Men,</hi> that are not <hi>equal to Gods Law,</hi> that may be <hi>chang'd,</hi> for which other <hi>Countries,</hi> that uſe them not, are to be <hi>condemn'd;</hi> whereas Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Order and Decency are the ſame throughout the <hi>World,</hi> ſome ſmall Local Differences allowed for.</p>
                  <p>This is the great Cauſe of Complaint: But on the other ſide, the Reaſons that appear to Diſſenters againſt them are great and weighty in themſelves: Let them be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Application; yet a great Reaſon on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any thing, if miſapprehended, is of much more weight, than a very ſlight and inconſiderable Reaſon for it, however true: And, though in a much inferiour Cauſe, I acknowledge, yet I hope it is not unlawful to make an Alluſion to that unavoidable Argument againſt Atheiſm, <hi>That the enduring of inconſiderable Inconveniencies, though certain, is much more eligible to a wiſe Man, than the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                     <p>The great Danger is either in exalting Gods Creatures into a ſtate, and for Uſes and Ends, above what he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them, at Humane pleaſure and arbitrament; or retrenching the Liberty God hath given in the free uſe of his own <hi>Creatures;</hi> for <hi>every Creature of God is good,</hi> and nothing to be refuſed, <hi>if received with thanksgiving: For it is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer.</hi> Now this cannot alike extend to the Signs and Ceremonies created by Humane Imagination, and impoſed with rigour, and that not only on Civil Accounts, which we meddle not with, but upon Religious, where God is only Supreme: At which Door hath entred all the Idolatry and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the World, winding it ſelf by leſſer Degrees, and ſo mounting it ſelf to the very top.</p>
                     <p>The great Uſe of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s two Diſcourſes, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be reſolved into this one main Poſition.

                     <p>In all which it is duly to be conſidered, That <hi>Scandal</hi> runs in the Induſtrious Impoſing and binding Obſervation, either by Example that expects Conformity to it, or any more violent Influence upon Compliance: That which the Apoſtle therefore perſwades to, was not any thing of <hi>Ritual Diſtinction of Days or Meats,</hi> but only the not eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch or ſuch Meats, happened in theſe two Caſes to be the Expedient againſt <hi>Scandal,</hi> he therefore perſwades the <hi>not eating</hi> upon theſe Contingencies, as by the by, which was a very eaſie performance for Chriſtian Charity; but the Thing he was wholly intent upon, was that great Doctrine of not <hi>Scandaliſing</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Indifferent Things.</hi> Theſe Circumſtances eaſily vaniſhed, the main Point remains unmoved. They were only a <hi>Scheme,</hi> a momentany and tranſitory one, to diſplay this great Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in, and to preſent it upon.</p>

                     <p>Seeing then all Humane Authority muſt lower its Top to Divine, I cannot ſee, but that, in <hi>Indifferent things in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> which is Gods peculiar, for we ſpeak only of that, the Magiſtrates Power is excluded, in caſe of real <hi>doubt</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in which a Man can do nothing, but he runs into Gods danger, even as in any other caſe of ſuch danger, by reaſon of Sin. And what is offered in Relief, will not avail, <hi>viz.</hi> That Obedience to Magiſtrates is certainly a Duty; but whether there be any diſobedience to God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch or ſuch <hi>Indifferents,</hi> is in <hi>doubt;</hi> and if the thing be indeed <hi>indifferent,</hi> it is a <hi>doubt</hi> upon miſtake: And then there is a diſobedience to God, in an <hi>undoubted</hi> Rule, and Command to avoid it in a caſe not only of <hi>doubt,</hi> but of miſtake.</p>
                     <p>This, I ſay, cannot avail; Becauſe the meaſure is not to be drawn betwixt Obedience to Magiſtrates in all <hi>lawful things,</hi> or <hi>things indifferent;</hi> but betwixt Obedience to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Obedience to that Rule of the Word of God in all caſes of <hi>doubt,</hi> which is as clear, and as little ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to <hi>doubt,</hi> as any Rule whatever. Yet does not this evacuate the Power of Magiſtrates, it being reſtrained to things <hi>indifferent</hi> in Religion, and in <hi>Doubt,</hi> and the <hi>Doubt</hi> fixed upon a grand Principle of Truth.</p>
                     <p>Nor is that of greater ſatisfaction, That in Obedience to Magiſtrates, there are ſo many degrees of Good, and ſo many of Evil in the Diſobedience; but in doing well or ill, concerning <hi>Indifferents,</hi> there are much fewer Degrees, both of the Good, and the Evil; therefore Obedience to God, in ſo great a <hi>Morality,</hi> as Obedience to Magiſtrates, is always to be preferred before our doing well in <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;</hi> and the fear of Evil in one, to be avoided much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than the ſame fear in the other.</p>

                     <p> The Reaſon of Diſſatisfaction is this, That the Meaſure is not betwixt the Morality of Obedience to God, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Magiſtrates, and doing well or ill about things <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> but betwixt the Morality of <hi>Obeying God</hi> in one of his clear and undoubted Precepts, and in another of the ſame Evidence and Clearneſs; which muſt needs be one and the ſame, and of the ſame Rate of <hi>Morality:</hi> Seeing Obedience to God is the <hi>Fundamental Morality.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it were not thus, the Magiſtrates Prohibition of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of the <hi>Cup in the Lords Supper,</hi> muſt exempt from Obedience to God in thoſe Duties; becauſe Obedience to Magiſtrates is a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, but the other <hi>Ceremonial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is out of Meaſure certain, Obedience to God is both the top and the bottom of all <hi>Morality;</hi> and although Obedience to Magiſtrates is a great point of <hi>Morality,</hi> yet Obedience to God is ſo before it, as to be the Meaſure of it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, if Obedience to God be to be valued not by his Authority, but by weighing the Precepts themſelves, much more Obedience to Magiſtrates is to be eſtimated by the Commands they give, of which <hi>Indifferents</hi> in Religion will never be made out to be worthy to be the Teſts, either of their Authority, or our Obedience; whatever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Men have ſaid therein.</p>
                     <p>Indeed among the Divine Commands, God hath choſen <hi>Mercy,</hi> rather than <hi>Sacrifice, honouring Parents,</hi> rather than <hi>Corban,</hi> but it is becauſe he hath ſo declared in his Word, and in Mens Conſciences.</p>
                     <p>But all the Laws of God do harmoniouſly Conſpire, and Subordinate themſelves one to another, among which O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Magiſtrates, and Preſerving the Government, and Peace of Conſcience, are none of the leaſt, nor of any conteſt, or diſtance of unkindneſs between themſelves: <hi>Whoſo is wiſe?

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already aſſerted, in anſwer to ſome parts of this Objection;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Religion and Piety are its own beſt Guards, and Devotion to God preſerv'd moſt awful, as well as moſt pure, in its own <hi>Spirituality</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That all Natural and Neceſſary Order and Decency, are always to be ſecured, as much as may be, as being above the <hi>Scale</hi> of <hi>meer Indifferents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Unity is to be preſerv'd in the <hi>Inviolate love of Chriſtians to one another,</hi> center'd in thoſe principal
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65165:154"/> Things, <hi>Love of God and Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> and not <hi>in one Face of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> which is, if plac'd upon <hi>Ceremonials,</hi> in its own Nature, as variable as the <hi>Phaſe of the Moon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. I add, The more Publick Societies in Religion are intended, and deſired to be, the more Comprehenſive the Forms of Union muſt be. The Prudence, and holy Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of that firſt <hi>Council</hi> we read of in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> is always to be followed: When the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were to come into the neareſt Union, and as great an <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> as was any way neceſſary, either in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Churches,</hi> or the <hi>whole Church;</hi> when Doubts and Diſputes had ariſen concerning the Terms of their Union, was that prime <hi>Canon</hi> made, (happy had it been, if that Pattern had been ever ſince kept to) <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and to us, to lay upon you no other Burden, than Theſe neceſſary Things; one neceſſary</hi> by a <hi>perpetual Morality, one other</hi> in the fear and danger of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or <hi>Scandal:</hi> The other two <hi>neceſſary</hi> at that time, but by alteration of Time they dropp'd off, as to any Religious Import; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as general Nature may check at them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Banding of Societies in unneceſſary Rites, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Eccleſiaſtick Intereſt and Domination, than of the Concerns of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. If there are ſuch Varieties, that ſome cannot ſerve God, without adorning their Worſhip with theſe <hi>Arbitrary Rites</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency,</hi> they muſt <hi>ſtand or fall to their own Maſter:</hi> If they <hi>have ſuch a Faith,</hi> ſeeing the Danger of <hi>Scandaliſing</hi> lies moſt on the ſide of Ceremonies, they are thoſe that ſhould <hi>have it to themſelves before God,</hi> not they that <hi>doubt;</hi> or, becauſe it is the Publickly Eſtabliſhed Order, they ſhould carry the <hi>Happineſs,</hi> the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of their <hi>full Perſwaſion</hi> humbly, and compaſſionately, being not <hi>high minded,</hi> but <hi>fearing,</hi> leſt in ſome parts of that, wherein they ſeem ſo clear, Cauſes of Condemning
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65165:154"/> themſelves lye hid at preſent, and afterwards ſtart out.</p>
                     <p>But all this cannot be a Standard for others; they that are <hi>doubtful</hi> ought not to be ſcrewed up, by Engines and Pullies, to this <hi>Happineſs:</hi> Seeing then there are ſome that dare not ſerve God in this way, we muſt ſeek out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Terms of Union, and they are very near us; the vital Union of Chriſtianity, our National Reformed Religion, which may ſubſiſt well enough, if we would let it, in theſe leſſer Diſtinctions.</p>
                     <p>It did not make <hi>diverſe Churches</hi> in <hi>Primitive Rome,</hi> that ſome Chriſtians diſtinguiſhed <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Days,</hi> and others did not.</p>
                     <p>Yet the aſſerting the Rights of the Goſpel-Freedom from <hi>Judaick Bondage,</hi> was of more concernment to the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> at that time, than all the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> of <hi>Deſpotick Ceremonies</hi> can be worth to it now.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore, as the Concluſion of this Head of <hi>Scandal,</hi> always remember, upon the point of Indifferency, That, <hi>All that it is, hath been nam'd already, and it is known to be Indifferency, and it may not contend with Scandal, that is mightier than it;</hi> for <hi>Scandal</hi> is <hi>Scandal,</hi> real Miſchief, and lays about it from every Quarter with Miſchiefs. How much better then is it, that <hi>indifferent</hi> things in Religion were taken away, even <hi>while the World ſtandeth,</hi> than that they ſhould be kept up as the Sconces of <hi>Scandal?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>Indifferent Things</hi> let not the <hi>Work of God be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor any for whom Chriſt dyed in danger to Periſh;</hi> the more we eſteem <hi>our Church, our Religion, our Worſhip of God,</hi> the better and purer they are, the more it is pity any ſhould be divided from it, ſhould be ſo far ſcandaliſed, as to be <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> from it, either in our account, or if it be <hi>that Sin,</hi> in the real danger of it, and of <hi>periſhing</hi> in it. The more excellent our <hi>Church</hi> is, the more the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> Rules take hold of us. Let not the <hi>good of our Church</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:65165:155"/> be evil ſpoken of, as if it was <hi>Ceremonial;</hi> Let us not loſe any from <hi>our Church,</hi> for <hi>Meat and Drink:</hi> Increaſe not the <hi>Woe of Scandal</hi> any way, for ſo mean Things, as <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us not indanger our ſelves into the <hi>Woe of him,</hi> by whom <hi>Scandal comes,</hi> for <hi>Elements.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But beſides all theſe Conſiderations, there is not ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a ſecurity in <hi>adding any thing,</hi> under any Name what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to the <hi>pure Worſhip of God,</hi> any more than to his <hi>Word, leſt we be found Lyars to him,</hi> miſmatching with it, what will not endure <hi>the Fire.

                     </p>
                     <p>The Argument ſtrikes all ways, if our Conſtitution be ſo good, and injur'd not at all by <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> let us, as Chriſt, <hi>Seek, and ſave that which is loſt;</hi> thoſe we look upon, as <hi>the leaſt, that believe in Chriſt,</hi> let them not be loſt for <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> The Love and Compaſſion of a Saviour, triumphs towards <hi>theſe leaſt,</hi> eaſily Offended, narrow-ſoul'd, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, ſuppoſe them; <hi>Smoaking Flax, bruiſed Reeds,</hi> yet <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them not,</hi> if <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> if <hi>Proteſtants.

                     </p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:65165:155"/>
                     <p> If on the other ſide, our Ceremonies in Gods account ſhould be blemiſhes of our <hi>Church,</hi> and Imperfections; or if they may be turned into ſuch by an ignorant uſe of them, or if they <hi>cauſe Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Scandals;</hi> if the Miſchiefs <hi>of thoſe Scandals</hi> fall upon Strangers to true Religion, and keep them at diſtance: All theſe conſiderations weigh hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy againſt a <hi>Zeal</hi> for them.</p>
                     <p>But if none of theſe can be laid to their Charge; yet if Men doubt concerning them, what muſt they do? How ſhall they eſcape that of the Apoſtle? <hi>He that doubteth is Damned if he Eats. Whatever is not of Faith is Sin.</hi> Why ſhould this be hazzarded for <hi>Indifferents?</hi> And when the Tyde of Advantages, Preferments, Publick Approbation, are on one ſide; Deprivation of all thoſe, Cenſures and Penalties on the other; who dares anſwer for many Men, that they do not offer Violence to their Principles, much more venture over their Doubts? And yet in thoſe very Doubts has the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> laid his Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Or Laſtly, Wo can reaſonably ſuppoſe, Men would ſtem this Tyde that is againſt them, if they had not real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Doubts, or higher than Doubts, to conteſt with in prejudice of their Complyance.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole then, I cannot but conclude, Impoſing Indifferent Things in Religion, by a violent Example; much more by ſevere Ways, is very contrary to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine in that Caſe; and that upon Reaſons, that till I ſee them anſwered, I muſt ſuppoſe unanſwerable.</p>
                     <p>I have now thus far diſcourſed of <hi>Scandal</hi> in the more ſtrict, and particular Caſes, Scripture hath given us the notices of; but in the remaining Heads to be treated of, I ſhall conſider it in that largeſt and moſt comprehenſive Graſp of it, <hi>Religion in general.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And there is nothing that requires greater Wiſdom, and the prepoſſeſſions of a more Religious Prudence, than to ſit, and <hi>count the Charge</hi> of undertaking ſerious Piety, as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65165:156"/> the Lord hath bidden us in relation to one Branch of <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, Perſecution;</hi> ſo with reſpect to the whole Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Scandal</hi> in the World.</p>
                     <p>It is the great both Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God in the Scripture, that he hath given full and ample warning before hand, of all the Diſadvantages we are to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in our <hi>Faith, Love,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> to him; as when we are aſſured, There ſhall be <hi>Falſe Prophets, There muſt be Hereſies, There ſhall be Perſecution, There ſhall be an Apoſtacy,</hi> or general Defection from <hi>True Symmetral Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> within <hi>Chriſtianity it ſelf:</hi> And ſo in the preſent Caſe, it muſt needs be that <hi>Scandals come.</hi> For the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things is one greateſt Defence againſt the Evil predicted, as alſo againſt the ſtaggering of our Minds, concerning the Truth of Religion it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Let any man then enquire, and ſearch this thing out, both in Scripture and cloſe Reaſon, and he will find <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals muſt come;</hi> though he may at firſt think, Religion, if it be ſo great and excellent as is given out of it, ſhould not be darkned and clouded with <hi>Scandal,</hi> but ſtand clear from it; and it be impoſſible it ſhould be any way liable to it.</p>
                     <p>Now that it is in it ſelf Juſt and Right, even to <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction it ſelf,</hi> is every where recorded and publiſhed of it. <hi>Wiſdom ſpeaks excellent things, and the opening its Lips are</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let us then reſume the Notion of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and fit it to this general Proſpect over Religion, I am now upon, and we ſhall find, as the <hi>Lord ſpeaks,</hi> that <hi>Scandals muſt come.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Scandal</hi> then is any Falſe Pretence or Appearance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Religion, or any of the nobler Objects, Parts, Rules, or Reaſons of it, are expos'd to Diſadvantage and Diſguſt, as unreaſonable, unjuſt, untrue, weak and empty; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, unlovely, and undeſirable; or the contrary, Sin, Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, and Diſobedience to God are gloſs'd over, and preſented, as in all regards, more chooſable, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired than Religion; and all things ſo intangled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd among themſelves, that Men are ſeduc'd from the eſteem of the Divine Law, and Obedience to it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnar'd in Sin; even by that juſtle, and diſorder <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> makes in the ſeveral Laws and Rules of Religion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves; and the blending with them the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Sin; upon which great diſhonour to God and Religion, ſharp Conflicts of Conſcience within it ſelf, Miſchief to the Souls of Men, and a general Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Religion enſues.</p>
                     <p>And now, how this muſt needs be, I ſhall undertake to ſhew, having only obſerved; Firſt,</p>
                     <p>That there are ſome main Things ſo neceſſary for our Knowledge, Faith, and Practice, that they are made exquiſitely clear, and moſt eaſie to be underſtood. <hi>He</hi>

                     <p>But beſides thoſe plain Truths, written with a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam in Nature it ſelf, beſides thoſe of <hi>clear Revelation,</hi> there are neceſſarily ſome deep Truths, concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, the Attributes of God, his Decrees, and Acts, ſome Myſteries of Chriſt, of Providence, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, that command Awe, Reverence, and Modeſty, and are not to be fathom'd and fully underſtood, and yet cannot be ſo divided, nor ſeparated from thoſe

                     <p>Theſe things now being premiſed, I come to ſhew, That in the firſt and beſt ſtate of Things, <hi>Scandals might come;</hi> and that in the corrupt and degenerate ſtate they <hi>muſt come.</hi>

                     <p>And firſt how they <hi>might come;</hi> and there muſt the ſame Original be aſſigned to <hi>Scandal,</hi> as there is to Evil and Sin it ſelf; for neither Sin nor <hi>Scandal</hi> can derive themſelves from the <hi>Holy, Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>Good Creator,</hi> who made all Things juſt and even; <hi>He, moſt upright, weighed out the Path of the Juſt by his</hi> own <hi>Eternal Perfect Way,</hi> and made the Angelical, and Humane, the whole Rational Nature, according to it, <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> ſo that there was no <hi>Scandal</hi> from this firſt beginning of Things. But when God made Creatures of Reaſon and Underſtanding, and of Free Will and Choice; Underſtanding in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it could ſearch and pry, and range every way; and look not only upon Things that are, but by Things that are, they could collect Things poſſible; from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Wiſe, Good, and Juſt, they could deſcry Folly, Evil and Wrong; and in Happineſs and Bleſſedneſs, they could behold, as in privation from them, Miſery and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, or the Tranſcendency and Infiniteneſs of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and the Degrees below it; they could trace and find out the Lines by which there roſe up a Supremacy of theſe, and back again, by which there was Declination of Degrees from this <hi>Azimuth,</hi> or inſuperable Height.</p>
                     <p>And as theſe Underſtandings are ſo great, ſo they are ſuited with Wills and Appetites as great, by which they could aſpire to be whatever they ſaw above themſelves; and to diſlike in whatever they found themſelves below.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65165:158"/> So that it was poſſible for them to diſlike their <hi>firſt Eſtates,</hi> to forſake their proper <hi>Manſions</hi> or Habitations, and leave them, as if they were not loughty, large, and roomthy enough for them. Thus the <hi>Angels</hi> left their <hi>Eſtate</hi> in Heaven, and <hi>Adam</hi> his in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> aſpiring to ſomething higher; and this through mutability, from miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, jealouſie, and diſguſt, ariſing from perfect miſtake, falſe appearance, and miſ-judging, which is perfect <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal.</hi> Thus not being Infinite, not being Omniſcient, nor able <hi>to find out the Almighty to perfection,</hi> nor reſting in the Love and Obedience of God in thoſe things moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, evident, and undoubted to them, but projecting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their own Sphere, they might come to <hi>charge</hi> Gods Holineſs, Goodneſs, and Wiſdom <hi>fooliſhly;</hi> to raiſe ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they were not high and well enough; obſerving how Evil lay from Good, they might in Diſcontent draw the Line of Evil upon Good, and <hi>charge</hi> Imperfection upon Perfection it ſelf; they might diſorder the moſt orderly Alliances, and confuſe the juſt Diſtances between Things and Things.</p>
                     <p>This they might poſſibly do, except God did interpoſe with his Immutability of Perfection for them, and ſecure them: But God permitting things to liberty, this muſt be poſſible to fall out.</p>
                     <p>This poſſibility of Change was the <hi>Folly</hi> God <hi>charged</hi> the pureſt <hi>Angels</hi> with, and in regard of which, <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were not clean in his ſight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the miſerable Conſequences of this Poſſibility com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into actual Event, the <hi>Good Angels</hi> were <hi>Elected,</hi> and into them the <hi>Bad Angels</hi> fell, who <hi>abode not in the Truth,</hi> but fell into <hi>curſed Scandal,</hi> and are wrapped up in <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi> fettered in it, even in <hi>Chains of darkneſs,</hi> which are Chains of <hi>Scandal,</hi> till the <hi>Judgment of the great day;</hi> that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Jude</hi> 6.</note> it may then be decided, whether they had juſt cauſe of <hi>Offence</hi> or not: Thus the Devil was <hi>a Lyar from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:65165:158"/> and the <hi>Father of</hi> it, of the <hi>Lye of Scandal:</hi> For all <hi>Scandal</hi> is <hi>a Lye, John</hi> 8. 44.</p>
                     <p>And now, when there was an actual Fall, a Defection of any of the Rational Creatures, actually come to paſs, God ſtill permitting things to their own Liberty, then it cannot be, but that <hi>Scandals come;</hi> For when once the Activity of an Underſtanding, carried with a perverſe and diſorderly Will, is in motion, then it traverſes all ways, cuts all thoſe Lines of Allyance and Connexion betwixt Things and Things, ſcales the heights, dives down into the bottom, fills all things with Confuſion and Perplexity, that it may <hi>Scandaliſe,</hi> miſ-repreſent, and miſ-report God, and Supream Goodneſs, extols forbidden Pleaſures and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, and an imaginary Happineſs, as if enviouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and that denial unreaſonably, and to no benefit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with.</p>
                     <p>And the more Agents there are thus perverted, and ill diſpoſed, the more <hi>Scandals</hi> muſt needs ariſe and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; when therefore Angels fell, or if ſome Principal fell firſt, there muſt needs be <hi>Scandals</hi> in motion from them, and they drew down innumerable <hi>leſſer Stars</hi> with them; when they propagated <hi>Scandal</hi> to Men, as we read in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Fall,</hi> and Men grew numerous and wicked, <hi>Scandals</hi> muſt needs come amain, and multiply themſelves: For ſo many ſinful and impure Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings at work, and hurried on by extreamly bad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Wills, <hi>Scandals</hi> muſt become like a Deluge, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but increaſe to a kind of Infinite, and muſt be preſſing every where; for there is no Light ſo clear, but a dim and dark Eye may report it black and obſcure, there is no way ſo ſmooth and even, but <hi>Lame Legs, Crooked Feet,</hi> being themſelves unequal, may <hi>ſtumble</hi> and <hi>fall in it:</hi> When a Man, as <hi>Solomon ſays,</hi> is caſt <hi>into a Net by his own Feet;</hi> when his <hi>Feet</hi> are a <hi>Net</hi> to themſelves, he muſt be <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed,</hi> and Catch'd wherever he goes. There is no Senſe ſo

Even the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Senſe, by Ignorance, or Malice, may be ſo tranſpos'd, as to be made moſt unintelligible Non ſenſe, and by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the parts from their due order one to another, may be perverted into Falſhood and Blaſphemy.</p>
                     <p>Thus therefore, by the Darkneſs of Mens minds, by the Maliciouſneſs and ill Deſigns of corrupted Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, enraged by impure Luſts and Paſſions, the plaineſt things in Religion may be miſ-underſtood, miſ-repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, miſ-reported, and diſguiſed out of themſelves; much more the more ſecret, retir'd, and even unfathomable parts of Divine Truth, Providence, and Government.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>God hath made every thing good, that he hath made,</hi> and his very permiſſions of Evil, are all over-ruled by him to Good; and even to us they may be Medicinal, and of uſe, if taken by the right Handle.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Scandal</hi> turns the very beſt things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Evil, to the Perſon <hi>Offended,</hi> and nothing can be ſo Good, that it both not ſo abuſe: The <hi>Spies</hi> it ſends out upon the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> bring up an <hi>ill Report of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Indifferent Things,</hi> that are by God prepared, and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to turn each way, either to uſe or not to uſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as Circumſtances lead, and both ways to be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for Good, <hi>Scandal</hi> hath a great hand over, and turns them to Evil all ways.</p>
                     <p>Things that are Evil, the Sins, and Falls of Men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good Men, or Bad Men, or Men ſeemingly Good, and inwardly Bad, are as the proper Dominion and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and it raiſes what it can againſt Religion by them.</p>
                     <p>Thus every thing, by the not only Permiſſion, but Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God upon the faln World, is ſubjected to <hi>Scandal,</hi> not <hi>willingly,</hi> for <hi>all things work together for good,</hi> as they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65165:159"/> are impreſſed with Motion from the Divine Hand; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by that, but ſo much as permiſſively, <hi>Scandal</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently tranſports them upon Evil.</p>
                     <p>Now things ſtanding thus, there is the <hi>God of Scandal</hi> and <hi>his Angels, the Angels of Scandal;</hi> the <hi>Divel,</hi> and the whole <hi>Hoaſt of faln Spirits;</hi> the Great Reaſons, and Wits of this World, the Prophets of <hi>Scandal;</hi> the Ambitious Powers, and Intereſts of Worldly Greatneſs, Secular Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Eccleſiaſtical Domination, Debauched Religion, and in one word, the whole Univerſe of Luſts, all at the ſervice of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and employed by it.</p>
                     <p>From hence are all thoſe Atheiſtick Diſcourſes, thoſe Heretical Opinions, thoſe Monſtrous Idolatries and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions; thoſe Burleſques of <hi>Lucian</hi> Wits, thoſe Bold and Authoritative Examples of general Wickedneſs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, and Irreligion, that have ſpread themſelves over the whole Earth, thoſe Severities in matters of Indifferency.</p>
                     <p>And where there is in any Time, or Place, ſuch a ſenſe of Truth and Religion, that any of theſe Evils, plain and bare-faced, take very little, but are hated and hooted at, every thing, that is better, is borrowed againſt it ſelf, the Mantle of Law and Right is put on, pretences of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are made the Rayment of things moſt contrary to it And in all times, True Religion, Piety and Vertue expulſed under the worſt Names, and covered with the ugly Vizor of Evil; it being hard to bring Goodneſs into miſ-repute in its own likeneſs, under its own appearance.</p>
                     <p>To this purpoſe beſides every Man, being the firſt and worſt <hi>Scandaliſer</hi> to himſelf, beſides the lower and leſſer Miniſteries of <hi>Scandal,</hi> within privater Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, there are in all Times and Places, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Councels of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and the Cabals of it, that are neither Idle, nor Lukewarm, but purſuing all things to the utmoſt.</p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65165:160"/>
                     <p> And the <hi>Men of this World</hi> are always greedy of <hi>Scandal,</hi> of receiving it, either through miſerable Ignorance, and Inapprehenſiveneſs, or from Propenſions of their own, and to ſerve their particular Occaſions; or as they embark their Intereſts in the Bottom of a <hi>Common Scandal,</hi> as moſt ſafe, and of the richeſt Return: or if it were no more, they are always ſo near of Kin to Degeneracy, and Depraved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Now lay all theſe together, and we may eaſily find, <hi>Scandals muſt come,</hi> not only <hi>leſſer Scandals,</hi> but greateſt and moſt prevailing ones, that do as it were ſweep the World before them.</p>
                     <p>If any thing therefore can be added to <hi>Scandal,</hi> it will be, we muſt expect it; though there hath been ſo much done upon it to improve it, and eſpecially ſince the Riſing, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and yet ſurviving Conteſt of the <hi>Weſtern Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme.</hi> And whether there may be yet a Reſerve in the Counſels of God for <hi>Scandal,</hi> before its Final Abolition, to unite and ſummon all its Strength, and become in a ſort <hi>Oecumenical;</hi> I mean the <hi>Scandal of Antichriſtianiſm</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; theſe latter Days muſt diſcover.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time I will not be afraid to ſay, There is a very horrible <hi>Scandal</hi> riſing at this very time, even a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Popery,</hi> placing ſuch an abſolute Dependence upon Succeſſion from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> (without cautioning for any thing of their true Spirit) and which ſo hangs Salvation at the Girdle of thoſe that would be their Succeſſours, as turns Chriſtianity into a moſt <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tirannick Party.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they that know the Scriptures, know aſſuredly, Chriſt hath founded no Rule, Government, or Authority in his Church, whatever, but whoſe whole diſplay of it ſelf is in Teaching, Inſtructing according to his Word: If that be not clear and evident, the whole Authority and Power falls to the Ground. This Word appearing in and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65165:160"/> with it ſelf, though by the Miniſters of it, hath the ſole Power over Conſcience: They that would Rule without this, as Rulers appointed by Chriſt in his Church, are but <hi>Lay-Elders, Lay-Biſhops,</hi> or indeed <hi>they leave the Word of God, and ſerve Tables.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in this Univerſal Rage of <hi>Scandal,</hi> God hath not ſo forſaken the World, but that his <hi>Spirit lifts up a Standard againſt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Evil is not Infinite, but is at all times ſtopp'd by Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, and true Goodneſs environing it on every ſide, and bounding it, that it cannot do what it has a mind to do, and is therefore forced to leave it undone; for it can go no farther than the Beings that carry it can go, and God is always above them, and hems them in on every ſide.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scandal</hi> hath only a permiſſion from God, a Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to manifeſt it ſelf; it is always ſubject to Truth, as Night is to Day: It is ſubject to be reduc'd, and contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as God pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>And thus have I finiſhed the Third Head of Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Scandal, It muſt needs be that Scandals come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come to a brief Diſpatch of the Fourth Head, The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the <hi>World's Woe</hi> becauſe of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let the <hi>Scandal</hi> be never ſo fair and plauſible in its Pretence, or Reaſons of Seduction from God and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is ſo great a Force of Truth and Higher Reaſon againſt it, that our Guilt and Condemnation is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in not reſiſting the Temptation: Nothing can juſtifie a Plea againſt the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> not an <hi>Angel from Heaven;</hi> we muſt pronounce <hi>Anathema</hi> upon him, if he undertakes it. There are ſuch Foundations of Truth laid by God, that cannot be moved; and they have ſuch Evidence and Aſſurance to all ſincere Minds, that there is no excuſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Guilt of being taken with <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65165:161"/> 2. There is therefore always ſome moſt Guilty Cauſe of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and its prevalency within every Man that is taken by it: Some Luſt and love of Evil that betrays him, and on which he is condemned. When <hi>Scandal</hi> rages moſt abroad, and comes with <hi>lying Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders,</hi> and <hi>with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> it is becauſe Men <hi>have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and receive not the <hi>Truth in the love of it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Scandal</hi> is it ſelf Miſery and Ruine: A Man cannot <hi>fall,</hi> and be <hi>ſnared,</hi> he cannot be <hi>wounded</hi> and <hi>broken,</hi> but he muſt be miſerable. Life, Health, Salvation are only in Obedience to God, and Conformity to his holy Will. <hi>Who hath Woe? Who hath Wounds? Who hath Grief?</hi> But he that hath received <hi>Scandal</hi> againſt the Divine Truth. This <hi>is a deep Ditch, he only that is hated of God falleth into it,</hi> as not to recover. It is vain to pretend the Force, the Power, the unavoidableneſs of <hi>Scandal,</hi> when it ſelf is Death and Ruine: How many are pleaſed with their <hi>Scandals,</hi> and will by no means part with them? Many excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they could not withſtand their Deceipt and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and will not apprehend their Caſe. The firſt cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace Death, or, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>love Death.</hi> The latter can have no other Pity at the higheſt, but that they are undone; their <hi>Scandals are upon them, and they pine away in them,</hi> as they ſpeak in <hi>Ezekiel, and how then ſhould</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>they live? God hath no pleaſure in their death,</hi> yet ſtill they dye, except reſtor'd by Repentance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Were it not for Scandal, were it not ſome unhappy and miſchievous miſ-repreſentation of Divine Goodneſs and Truth, were there not ſomething that impoſed upon the Underſtanding, and ſeduced the Will, with a falſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Truth and Good, Rational Beings could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Truth, nor fall out with Infinite Goodneſs; or on the other ſide, entertain Falſhood, or fall in love with Evil, and ſo would be every way ſecure from Deſtruction: Surely,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65165:161"/> were it not for <hi>Scandal,</hi> ſome moſt miſchievous poſſeſſion upon our Minds, while there are any hopes of Mercy, we could not refuſe and reject it, nor cleave ſo faſt to ſin and death, which can have no deſirableneſs, but to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Soul;</hi> as Holineſs and the Favour of God cannot be diſguſtful to any, but the <hi>Scandaliſed:</hi> Were it not for ſome indiſſolvable <hi>Scandal,</hi> even the ſin againſt the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> might be repented of, and forgiven; ſome irreconcileable prejudice <hi>retains</hi> both the <hi>ſin</hi> and ſo the <hi>puniſhment.</hi> And in Hell there is that <hi>Eternal Scandal</hi> for ever holding faſt the Damned, That a Creature deprived of God juſtly hate and rebel againſt him: Or it is beſt for it in that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſo to do. Were it poſſible to be looſed from this <hi>Snare of Death,</hi> this <hi>Everlaſting Chain of Darkneſs,</hi> there might be an eſcape out of Hell it ſelf: Were there not an Eternal Diſcontent and Diſguſt to God, Hell could not be Hell, nor Devils Devils any longer; ſo miſerable a thing is <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fifth Head in this Diſcourſe is <hi>the accumulative Woe to him by whom Scandal cometh;</hi> the <hi>Woe</hi> by way of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendency.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Deſigners of Scandal muſt be as ſo many <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> in the World, of the juſt contrary Spirit and Action to God and Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit in the World; and therefore ſhall be for ever ſeparated from that Bleſſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, into <hi>that Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</hi> the <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>the Angels</hi> of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some have in all Ages been brandedly infamous herein, but none like him, <hi>whoſe coming is after Satan, with lying Signs and Wonders, and all deceivableneſs of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All thoſe Atheiſtical Defamations of God, and Religion, and the Scurrilities of Prophane Wits, are deeply dyed in this Guilt. They are like the throwing <hi>of Firebrands, Arrows,</hi> and <hi>Death; ſo is the Scandaliſing of Men in ſuch ſports of Wit, to their Ruine.</hi>

                     <p> Yet their Guilt is meaſured by the proportion of the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> in its own Nature, the malignancy of the Intention, the ſtupid, or ſeared careleſneſs of the Event, but not by the Event it ſelf; whether the <hi>Scandal</hi> prevail upon others, or not; or whether they that are Scandaliſed, repent, or not.</p>
                     <p>Becauſe the Guilt of the Scandaliſed is reckon'd to him, by his own Degrees of Light, his circumſtances of defence againſt, or extream danger of falling into the temptation, by his own love of Sin, or enmity againſt the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> in which every Man is the principal <hi>Scandaliſer</hi> to himſelf; and his recovery out of the <hi>Scandal,</hi> depends upon his own Repentance, or Obduracy againſt the means of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>The Guilt of the <hi>Scandaliſer</hi> is meaſured alſo, by his own ſtate in Sin in general, his ſtate in relation to that Sin of <hi>Scandaliſing,</hi> his Continuance in it, or Repentance from it, and not by what befalls the <hi>Scandaliſed;</hi> elſe the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi>'s <hi>Salvation</hi> had been hopeleſs, without the certain Repentance of all thoſe <hi>he compelled to Blaſpheme.</hi>

                     <p>Repentance, and Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and the Mercy of God in him, are the only means of recovery out of this <hi>Snare of Death,</hi> both to the <hi>Scandaliſer,</hi> or <hi>Scandaliſed,</hi> and a certain means it is to either.</p>
                     <p>Before I come to the laſt Head of this Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to draw down the whole Meditation ſo, as that it may be moſt fitted to Practice, I will endeavour to reſume the whole diffuſive Notion of <hi>Scandal</hi> into one Uniform Repreſentation, deſcending from the General into the Particulars of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Original Scandal</hi> is that diſlike, and exception, the Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creature took to the Creator's Supream diſpoſe over it, and its diſguſt to that State wherein infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs had placed it; ſo that inſtead of a thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcency in it, to its happineſs; it hath proved a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and a Vagabond from it, to its Ruine.</p>

                     <p> Reaſon of this at firſt there could be none, but a diſdain to have its large Capacities of Underſtanding confined, or dictated to, or its Freeborn <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And whether this <hi>Scandal</hi> is firſt in the Underſtanding, or Will, is not material; for the Union is ſo Vital between them both, that what is in one, is at the ſame time, and as they ſay, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> in the other.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>This then is the firſt great <hi>Scandal,</hi> at which the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> fell, a diſcontent at a ſtate of Obedience, and Subjection to God, and his Commands, how <hi>Holy, Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> ſoever; as if it were too Arbitrary upon Beings, that could underſtand and chuſe for themſelves, to be ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                     <p>They did not <hi>like</hi> to conſider, to <hi>retain</hi> upon their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not only that they had their Beings given them, and that their Obedience was an abſolute Due to the Creator, but that it was Obedience to an Infinitely <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator,</hi> truer to the Intereſt of his Creatures,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65165:163"/> than themſelves could be: This <hi>Scandal</hi> therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon them, drew along the whole Tain of miſery with it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Scandaliſed</hi> Spirits always report ill of God and his Laws, ſo far as they are <hi>Scandaliſed,</hi> and they that are entering into <hi>Scandal,</hi> too contentedly hear ill of him, as appears in the Dialogue betwixt the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and the <hi>Firſt Man and Woman.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Spirits utterly loſt by <hi>Scandal,</hi> act in defiance of God, and are the more enraged by finding the Miſery of their <hi>Scandal</hi> preſſing upon them, even to deſpair, as we ſee in the <hi>Devils.</hi> Humane Nature, is more modeſt and tender, being ſuccoured by Grace, and the <hi>promiſed Seed,</hi> in our firſt Parents: and their Poſterity preſerved from the utmoſt miſchief of <hi>Scandal,</hi> by that Great Reſtorer from <hi>Scandal;</hi> Not perfectly recovered, but in a ſtate of ſecond Probation, of riſing after ſo great a Fall, or being moſt unhappily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſunk below thoſe hopes, and made for ever the prey of <hi>Scandal,</hi> even after Grace offered.</p>
                     <p>This State of Humane Nature is waved, and various. In ſome things Men are more clear and free, in others hooked, and ſtaked with <hi>Scandal;</hi> and wherein they are Right in the Generals, they are often inſnared in the Particulars, and ſo that their freedom in the one, giving them more room and ſpace to ſtir, inwraps them more in the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> of the other. By degrees, if not reſtor'd, men loſe the modeſty and tenderneſs preſerv'd to them by Grace, and fall into the very <hi>Scandal</hi> of the Devils themſelves, or very near to it.</p>
                     <p>However in all <hi>Scandal</hi> there are ſome of the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Primitive <hi>Scandal;</hi> and the greater the <hi>Scandal,</hi> the more, and the more apparent, are thoſe ſtrokes of the firſt <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in every <hi>Scandal</hi> an Underſtanding that will be wiſer than God is for it, a diſguſt to ſelf Reſignation into the Divine Will.</p>

                     <p> There is ſome Luſt that clouds and darkens the Mind and there is ſome falſe Principle that imboldens Luſt.</p>
                     <p>

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> obſerves, <hi>The Carnal Mind is Enmity to the Law of God, it is not ſubject to it, neither indeed can be.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. To a Falſe, a Formal Religion, Damnable Hereſies, or a Superſtition in place of Religion, raging with great ſhew of Zeal, and Devotion againſt True Religion, which while men bloodily purſue <hi>they think they do God good ſervice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From thoſe that are more ſerious in the True Religion, theſe <hi>Scandals</hi> eſpecially ariſe.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. The great and many, and ſharp Differences among thoſe, that are the Profeſſors of Religion, made moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable by the high Feuds, and furious Rencounters that give ſport to the Enemies of it, in traducing it, and every way enfeeble it among themſelves, are great <hi>Scandals.</hi>

The ſtrange Antipathy in Religious perſons againſt permitting the due Liberty to Conſcience in things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or in all things that are not expreſly commanded, or forbidden by God, that men either upon the known Principles of Natural Religion, or their own Principles, and acknowledged Conſequences from them, cannot deny; which is many ways deſtructive of the true power of Religion, wherever it takes, being the <hi>Scandal</hi> of acting againſt <hi>Senſe</hi> or <hi>Conſcience.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as hath been ſhewn, ſo remarks upon, and is however a great diſcouragement to the entrances into, and loſs of Reputation to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, by the Claſhes between thoſe that cannot comply becauſe they <hi>Doubt,</hi> and thoſe, that either will not believe them, when they ſay they <hi>Doubt,</hi> or think them not able to underſtand whether they <hi>doubt,</hi> or not; or would drive them againſt the expreſs Rule of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> though it be allowed they do <hi>doubt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus I have deſcribed <hi>Scandal,</hi> in which the whole un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Nature of man is <hi>Seated,</hi> though ſome are deeper than others in it.</p>
                     <p>The very beſt men are under the Remains of it, and are never perfect from it, till in the ſtate of <hi>Juſt Spirits made perfect,</hi> where <hi>Scandal</hi> cannot enter.</p>

                     <p>And now the miſery of <hi>Scandal</hi> runs along with it: All Diſobedience to the Divine Commands, which are <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life,</hi> is <hi>Scandal</hi> in the Deception firſt, and after falls down into the miſerable ſtate, in which it always remains, but never ends, expreſſed by <hi>the Worm that never dies, the Fire never quenched, the weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth for ever.</hi> Every one that <hi>maketh,</hi> and <hi>he that receiveth the lye of Scandal</hi> are <hi>caſt</hi> into <hi>the Lake</hi> that <hi>burneth with Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> which is <hi>the ſecond Death,</hi> but he that maketh that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And now I am more immediately, and nearly, to fall upon what concerns us in a way of Practice, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Scandal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let us ſeriouſly apprehend the great Folly of taking hold of <hi>Scandal,</hi> and making advantage of it againſt any of the Rules, and Laws of Religion: It is no other, than ſucking in a Common Infection, or Contagion, becauſe it is common, or taking into our ſelves a Reaſon, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Reaſon, to be Eternally undone and miſerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt are ſo. The <hi>Scandaliſing,</hi> and the <hi>Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed</hi> World periſh together; they that bring the Peſtilenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Contagion, that runs deep in their own Veins, and they that draw it in to themſelves from others. What recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, or allay of Anguiſh will it be to us, that there were ſuch and ſuch Offences, or Cauſes of Exception to Religion, and the Ways of it? And that we ſaw they took mightily in the World, that they were generally received? When
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65165:166"/> all is but <hi>making</hi> a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Death,</hi> and binding over our ſelves to it: Can there be any Cauſe juſt enough, why we ſhould be Damned, and loſe our ſelves for ever? Or will it ſatisfie us for our Souls, that others periſh with us?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is therefore every Mans Intereſt, to arm himſelf with all the Reaſons he can againſt <hi>Scandal,</hi> (as there are ſufficient) and to reſiſt this <hi>Enemy</hi> at the very <hi>Gates.</hi> It is only that we are deeply <hi>Scandaliſed</hi> firſt againſt Religion, that we go up and down, as it were inquiring for <hi>Scandal,</hi> for ſome to <hi>Scandaliſe</hi> us, and to give us further ſhew of Reaſon againſt being Religious: Were our Hearts but true to Religion, we ſhould eaſily find, they are <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>ſtronger,</hi> that are <hi>with it,</hi> than that are <hi>againſt it.</hi> If our <hi>Eyes were opened,</hi> the Reaſons for Religion are like a <hi>Mountain full of Charriots and Horſes of Fire,</hi> that cannot be reſiſted. Our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs therefore is not, if we ſincerely reſolve, that <hi>we</hi> and <hi>our</hi>

That we are ſo unequally poiſed, ſo propenſe upon <hi>Scandal,</hi> is, becauſe our Hearts are firſt bribed toward Sin, and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy</hi> from God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This ſhould engage us to take heed to our ſelves, to beware of our own proper <hi>Scandal,</hi> the motion, prejudice, and paſſion that grows from our own falſe Underſtanding, or Luſt, and does and will <hi>ſcandaliſe</hi> us, though there were no other <hi>Scandal</hi> in the World; theſe will make us fall into Diſlike or Diſcontent with any of the ways of Holineſs and our Duty, when they do not ſatisfie our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Apprehenſions, Affections, or Deſires. <hi>Let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ways wholly to the Lord, and he will give us the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires</hi>

                  <p>I Call this <hi>A Catechiſm,</hi> becauſe I deſign it a Familiar Inſtruction in Fundamental Truths, Reſounding the ſame Thing from Queſtion to Anſwer; the eaſieſt way of Conveying Truth, and Imprinting it upon the Minds of thoſe that are even of the meaneſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: But eſpecially, becauſe the Principles of it are to be daily ſo Meditated upon, Pondered and Applyed to uſe, as to be a perpetual ſound in our Ears, and ſo to be properly ſtiled <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Things of ſuch great weight, as Principles are, muſt have as the moſt Advantageous Adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>the Truth, and not Selling it,)</hi> ſo they muſt have the moſt Eaſy, and Ready Application to all their Uſes and Ends: <hi>They muſt therefore be bound conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually about our Neck, that when we go, they may lead us; that when we ſleep, they may keep us; that when we wake, they may talk with us,</hi> Prov. 6. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>I know the Things I have written cannot be duely received without much Thinking, and without that they will be in danger of a Cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rejection from the moſt, or of a ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al unintelligent Acceptance in the Kinder; which is as bad as the other, and therefore I preſent it as a <hi>Catechiſm;</hi> to thoſe that ſhall at all approve it, that they may be throughly verſed in it, and the Senſe of it grow Domeſtick to them.</p>
                  <p>I call it a <hi>Catholick Catechiſm,</hi> only with Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Great Subjects it Treats of, the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in thoſe things wherein they are <hi>Catholick;</hi> or in which their <hi>Catholickneſs</hi> conſiſt: That is, that they are of God, and that the whole Society of Holy and Happy Spirits is by that <hi>Catholickneſs</hi> united, and cloſely banded with it ſelf. <hi>Catholick,</hi> as the Epiſtles called <hi>Catholick,</hi> that is, after ſome Doubt Aſſerted to be Divine, of the Publick Spirit of God, and giving that Publick Doctrine, in which the General Aſſembly is one.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:65165:172"/>
                  <p> I have endeavoured to contrive the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Anſwers ſo, that the Anſwers may be an <hi>Apology,</hi> or Defenſive Anſwer of that <hi>Catholick Truth,</hi> giving a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or a <hi>Rational Account,</hi> to any Demand that can be made upon it: And it is the <hi>Apology</hi> of that Truth it ſelf; the <hi>Apology</hi> it gives and furniſhes us with, for other can no Man give: Truth can need no other, than its <hi>Native Apology</hi> for it ſelf; no other will it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
                  <p>To give this, and to be always ready to give it, to keep it within us, and to have it fitted to our Lips, is the proper Fruit of ſuch a <hi>Catecheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Inſtruction;</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> aſſures us, it is the great Duty of Chriſtianity, and the greateſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour we can do to God, Firſt to <hi>Sanctifie him in our Hearts, by a full acknowledgment of him in his Divine Truth;</hi> by a <hi>Plerophory, or full Aſſurance of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the Myſtery of God, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and of Chriſt.</hi> For a Devotion to the True God, without knowing him to be the True God, cannot thus Sanctifie or Honour him.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing we ſhould be more Rational in, than in the True Religion, the Account of which, and of its whole Content, ought to be ſo certain to us, that nothing of a Diverſe Spirit from it, can be added to it; nor any thing of its Integral or Eſſential Nature taken from it; but
<pb facs="tcp:65165:173"/> we may plainly ſee, it would change the Account; and ſo we need not make a Traverſe over all Falſehood to know Truth, but by having a Right underſtanding in, and Juſt Contemplation of Truth, the moſt even thing in the whole World; we come to know it ſelf, by it ſelf, and to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of it, although there were no other Falſe Religion in the World to compare it with, and ſet it off by, and withal to deſcry <hi>every falſe way</hi> offered to us, and to <hi>hate it:</hi> Yea we obſerve every thing that is but doubtfully Propoſed, and ſtay it its due time of Examination, and ſo either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or reject it, or if we ſee full reaſon for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtill ſuſpend.</p>
                  <p>It is not the Laws of our Country, our Church, our being Baptiz'd, or Educated in it, that will juſtifie our Religion to be the True: It is not the High Reverence of it, the Devotion we uſe in it, our hating of thoſe that ſpeak Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemouſly of it, will make good our Religion, what Religion in the World may not be juſtified upon ſuch Topicks? It is not that we find many great Principles of Truth in a Religion, that will juſtifie it: There is no Religion, that can be called R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ligion, that does not eſpouſe many True Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: And in Chriſtian Religion, Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm vies with Chriſtianity it ſelf upon the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Creeds, which it ſelf Confeſſes with True
<pb facs="tcp:65165:173"/> Chriſtanity, but hath Built upon them New Creeds of its own, and ſo Corrupted all: For what is ſo pure, and perfect, as True Religion is, muſt needs be Corrupted by any Addition: All that is Pure and True, is already its own; who then can add to it, and not be found a Lyar?</p>
                  <p>Nothing therefore, as I have already intimated, can be our ſecurity for True Religion, but the <hi>Juſt Divine Meaſure,</hi> the <hi>Common Faith,</hi> the <hi>True Catholick Standard,</hi> which in all things neceſſary to the main End, is moſt evident, and in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing that is not ſo evident, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo upon this Great Teſt, this is our Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
                  <p>For it is very plain, there is leſs danger when our Underſtandings are not yet extended to the breadth of Divine Truth, (if none of the Vital Principles are unknown to us, unſenſed by us, which are ſo exceedingly plain, that we cannot be, except willfully, ignorant of them,) for no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is done to Truth, that we do not underſtand its whole Compaſs; nor to our ſelves, if we do not hate knowledge, offering it ſelf to our notices, but in adding to Truth, ſeeing we can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to add, but what is of no worth, we muſt needs defile it; in having only Truth, though we have not all Truth, we yet are under the Influence of Truth only, but when we add,
<pb facs="tcp:65165:174"/> we enſlave our ſelves to <hi>Lying Vanities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now hereunto have I levelled the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> or Diſcourſe; againſt which I know many prejudices will lie, except full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration be allowed: I know too many things raiſe a Deteſtation at the firſt, which being Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and Weighed by their Reaſon, gain not only the Diſcharge of theſe Angry Paſſions, but much Acceptance and Aſſent: And I muſt take the Confidence to ſay, in relation to any ſuch Doubt upon the enſuing <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Catholick Truth,</hi> that it is ſettled upon ſuch unmoveable Reaſon, and Weigh'd out by ſuch exact atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to it, that I may write upon it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Immodeſty; <hi>Loe this, we have ſearched it, ſo it is, hear it, and know thou it for thy good;</hi> for good in the Quiet and moſt Peaceable Courſe of Chriſtianity, wherein to know the True Grounds upon which it reſts, alone makes the Soul both Wiſe and Good, and determines it to the Square and Juſt Rules of that Holy Religion; for Good in times of Temptation to a Falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, eſpecially that which calls it ſelf <hi>Catholick.</hi> For the truly Inſtructed Chriſtian, in that which is indeed <hi>Catholick,</hi> is even Impregnable againſt that Deluſion of <hi>Catholick, falſely ſo called;</hi> Laſtly, for good, in the midſt of great Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Diverſities of Opinion and Practice, in
<pb facs="tcp:65165:174"/> relation to leſſer things, pertaining more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantially, or Doubtfully to True Religion, wherein the Rational Chriſtian carrying it as Inoffenſively and Communicatively as he can with all, centers in that which is <hi>Catholick,</hi> as to his Faith, Love, Inward Eſteem, and Practice, and unmoveably fixes there, deteſting all Animoſity, and much more rigour or ſeverity towards others in Relation to ſuch differences, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more ungenerous, more unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, more irreligious, more unworthy.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65165:177"/> Grace and Favour, according to all his Divine Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of himſelf; and in ſo doing we are joined, and join our ſelves, as far as we can, with one another, in the ſame Religious Services performed by all.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why do you call it Catholick, or truly Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe God, to whom we properly and firſt Unite in Religion, is the moſt Publick and Univerſal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in whom all holy Spirits unite one with another; and from whom whoever ſeparates, ſeparates alſo from all good Spirits, and ſo falls into the only dangerous Schiſm.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe the One God, and Jeſus Chriſt his Son, our Lord, the One Mediator, would have all come to the Knowledge of this, as the Catholick Truth, that they might be ſaved; and hath therefore reconciled, and reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulated all in Heaven and Earth, into one Catholick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, in himſelf the Catholick Head.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe Gods Manifeſtations of himſelf are the only true Publick Authentick Records of this Religion, and all other not derived from hence are private and falſe, and the Meetings ſet up to celebrate any other Religion, than thus manifeſted, are indeed the cloſe Schiſmatical Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: For none can be Publick Aſſemblies, where God, the ſupremely Publick, and all holy Spirits, withdrawn with him, are not: And all are Publick, though but of two or three, where God the Publick it ſelf, and in whom the whole Aſſembly of Saints meets, is in the midſt of them.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Whence do you take occaſion to call that Publick, or Catholick, that is Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> From the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who when he is aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning the certainty of the Scripture Prophecy, affirms it a Principle abſolutely neceſſary to be known, that it is not of any Private Interpretation; and that he may demonſtrate it cannot be Private, he avows the Original
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65165:177"/> to be Divine. Now the plain Oppoſite to Private is Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; in that therefore the Apoſtle does not oppoſe Publick, but Divine, to Private; it is plain in his ſenſe, Divine is the only Publick; and whatever is truly Publick is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and all elſe Private.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How therefore are we to underſtand Private, to oppoſe it to Publick or Divine?</hi>
                     </p>

To thoſe that have no Publick Character of Office or Magiſtracy. And laſtly, to ſuch whoſe care, intereſt, and concern is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to themſelves and their own: Even thus Private is juſtly affixed to all; except only to God, and Religion as derived from him. No created Knowledge, either Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or Humane, is comprehenſive enough to be the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; no Power or Authority is ſupreme or vaſt enough to Enact; nor is any care or concern for the world of Souls, large or receptive enough to Ordain a Catholick Religion leading to a Common Salvation, but his who is the Father of the whole Family of Spirits in Heaven and Earth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Evidence of this is there?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo much the Reſult of Reaſon, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſiders it, cannot deny it; and upon this account, all who have pretended to found a Religion, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſome way or other to derive and receive it from God. For who can know all that is neceſſary to be known, but the Divine Mind and Spirit, that knows and ſearches it ſelf, the Spring of all things, and ſo firſt to be known? Or what Authority can preſcribe without, much leſs againſt Omnipotency? Or who can ſpread tender Mercies over all the Creation, but the Faithful Creator himſelf? All which are abſolutely neceſſary to the Concernments of the truly Catholick, Publick Religion.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The ſecond Record is Divine Revelation collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Holy Scriptures; All Scripture is given by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and is profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Correction in Righteouſneſs; that the man of God may be perfect, throughly furniſhed to every good work. No Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of Scripture is of any Private Interpretation; for Propheſie came not in old time by the Will of Man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And even as the Law of Nature is ſeal'd by Creation and Providence, ſo hath Revelation always been by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Divinity, and Miracles; a new Creation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the Ends of thoſe Revelations: Miracles of meer Power or Juſtice, as upon <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> of greateſt Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Benefaction only, as by the moſt merciful Saviour; of Mercy, and ſometimes of Juſtice, as by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and the Apoſtles, who were to eſtabliſh the Laws of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:65165:178"/>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>I perceive then all the things of Religion were not clear to Man by the Law written in his heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: For ſome Parts of Religion are ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our very Natures, as Men, that they were concrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with us, and engraven upon our very Souls, and the immediate motions of our Faculties muſt needs lead us to them, while right and ſtreight, and continuing in that perfect ſtate wherein our Creator left them.</p>
                     <p>For he looked upon all things that he had made, and behold all was good, and very good: And he appointed a Sabbatiſm for all his Creatures, and eſpecially his Rational Creatures, the Morning Stars, to ſing together, and praiſe him for them.</p>
                     <p>But there are other Divine Truths, which are as the breaking up of the Great Deep of the Infinite Wiſdom, Grace, and Goodneſs of God, that can be known to the higheſt Underſtandings of Angels, or Arch-Angels, only by Revelation: Much leſs to Man, a Reaſon of a lower Orb, and leaſt of all, as fallen and corrupted.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſuppoſing the Souls of Men had abode in their firſt Clearneſs and Luſter, all his Faculties would have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately received and adored God in all ſuch Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of himſelf, and Congratulated thoſe mighty Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Light and Truth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But what need was there of any Revelation, when Man was made perfect and good, while he continued ſo?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Revelation was even then neceſſary, to ſhew, that it is not conſiſtent with the Nature of a Creature to have Happineſs and Perfection within it ſelf; but to be in continual dependence upon, and expectation from the Creator: For even that Perfection wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was made, was thus to maintain, continue, and aſſure it ſelf; and ſo to riſe to higher Perfection; He had therefore at firſt a Doctrine by Revelation, ſutable to the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Trees, ſo that though he was Perfect, as ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65165:179"/> a Creature without Sin, yet he was made with a poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of higher Advancement, and Perfection; as he was of falling from his preſent Perfection, by not adhering to his Creator, according to what was revealed to him.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Relation do theſe two Records bear to one another, being both of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is therefore impoſſible, they ſhould either of them one contradict another, but that they unite with, confirm, and juſtifie one another, and one paſs out of, and repaſs into another; but the latter being more full, clear, and perfect, makes not only the Additions of what was not contained in the former, but does much inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and clear it; and ſince the Fall, it is no where elſe perfectly to be found, but in Revelation: Yet ſo, that whatever of it remains, or is reinkindled by Revelation, does both prepare a Man to receive, and does alſo aſſure him the truth of Divine Revelation.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>You have ſhewed with what Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and excellent Contrivance, all things were laid by the Creator, let me now hear from you the uſe I am to make of it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This teaches us to adore, applaud the Fidelity and Goodneſs of our Holy Maker, and to confeſs whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſorder hath invaded this State of things is owing altogether to the perverſeneſs and weakneſs of Man, whoſe Deſtruction is of himſelf alone, and his help only in God, returning him to himſelf according to this firſt Deſignation.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What then is the Supreme End of this Publick and Catholick Religion?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>That Men have a Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> a Knowledg of, and Government of their own Actions, with Approbation of them if Good, and Diſlike if Bad.</p>
                     <p>That there are Rewards and Puniſhments beyond this Life.</p>

That it might be a Standard to puniſh Prophaneneſs and Irreligion by, without entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on Conſcience; which Revelation cannot be, but in ſome peculiar Circumſtances. 6. That Men may on all Occaſions treat with one another by it, on Terms of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> with the Men of <hi>Athens,</hi> with <hi>Felix;</hi> and generally Men one with another, in all their Commerce: All Society, good Laws and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Reſtraint of exceſſive Evil, depending upon it.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>SEeing there is, by all that hath been ſpoken, ſo great a weight reſting upon Revelation, let the Accounts of Gods Revealing himſelf to Mankind be more fully ſtated.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides Gods Revealing himſelf to <hi>Adam,</hi> even in Innocency, in a Doctrine ſuitable to thoſe two Sacramental Trees, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, and the Tree of Life; and beſides that Original Revelation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> after the Fall, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents Head;</hi> he hath been pleaſed to guide that Holy Seed, which is his Church, by Revelation, as by a Pillar of Fire, throughout ſucceeding Ages, till he compleated the whole he intended, in a Kingdom of Truth, that cannot be ſhaken, which is to continue to the end of the World.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How then did God deal with the reſt of the World?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Even they were for ſome conſiderable Spaces, in the firſt Ages of the World, within the Advantages of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, by mixture with, or Neighbourhood to the Church, by Tradition from the Holy Patriarchs, which if they had faithfully obſerved, together with the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Natures Light, it would have ſecured them in True Religion: Beſides, that they who were faithful in theſe, were on all proper occaſions provided for by the Faithful Creator (though they were not ſtrictly of that Seed) with immediate Revelations: But when all theſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65165:183"/> were corrupted, as they were in the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, God withdrew himſelf by degrees, as the Glory did from the Temple in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> till there was nothing left but the Darkneſs of Tradition; fearfully debauch'd; falſe Deductions from Nature's Light, and worſe than that, the Devils Oracles in the room of Gods; ſo that there was in the generality of the Nations a ſecond and more deſperate Fall of Mankind from the true Religion, the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and a ſmall Proſelytiſme to that only excepted.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Examples are there of Gods continuing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to any parts of Mankind, out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family, juſtifying him, as not departing from men till they departed from him?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſw. Melchiſedek,</hi> no deſcendent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> was King of Righteouſneſs, and King of Peace, at the ſame time the Church was placed in <hi>Abrahams Seed; Laban</hi> was not wholly revolted from true Religion: But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, of the Poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> were eminent Inſtances of the Favour of God, that whole Book of <hi>Job</hi> teſtifying, that being helped by Holy Tradition, together with occaſional Revelations, they held the Light of Nature at its own Purity.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How was the Light of Revelation conveyed to the People of God in Elder Times?</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65165:184"/> of Divinity as over-ballanc'd all doubt: Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe, were the ordinary and familiar Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Patriarchs, and Holy Men, grounded upon Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Revealed Religion.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How did God conclude his Manifeſtations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the way of immediate Revelation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By ſpeaking in the laſt Days by his Son, and the Apoſtles immediately Commiſſioned by him, ſealing up Viſion and Propheſie in the fullneſs and Complement of Truth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Did God take any care for the ſecuring the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Truth given out by Revelation?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, very early; how early we know not; but beyond Controverſie in the firſt forming the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church into a ſetled Body, he began the more ſure and certain way of committing his Word and Will to Writing, and for the Honour of it, ſet the Copy with his own Hand, and continued it till the whole Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was compleat: Paſſant Revelation, or Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, not being ſure enough.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherein is the Written Word more ſure than the Word in paſſing Revelation or Tradition?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Word committed to Writing ſtands unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Divine Providence watching over what was Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to keep it the ſame. All Covenants and Treaties, all Monuments of Knowledge have been thus ſecured, tranſmitted into all Parts, and conſigned to after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: Appeals in Caſes of doubt are more ſafely made to what is Written, and every one concerned has a ready and open way to Examine, and in all Caſes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Have all Nations ſince the Days of the Bleſſed Seed been Communicated with theſe Revelations?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There hath been a Freedom given to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them, and a Right in all Nations to demand
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65165:184"/> the benefit of them granted by God and Chriſt to them, but there are many ſad Accounts to be given, why this Univerſal Grace to Mankind has not yet taken Effect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The unaccountableneſs of the Methods of Gods Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World, in the Efficacies of his diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Goodneſs, even when things ſeem equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the advantage of one, as of another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Experiment made upon ſo great a part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that have the Goſpel, juſtifies God in not effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveying it to others, who would make as ill an uſe of it: The Idolatry Superſtition of ſome, the ſottiſh Ignorance, Sloath and neglect of others: The Cruelty and Barbarity exerciſed by Chriſtians upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the unanſwerable living to it in all Sects, make plain the great perverſeneſs of our degenerate Nature, and how Nations that have not the Goſpel, would have abuſed it if they had had it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But eſpecially the great Enmity to, and Contempt of the Heavenly Doctrine, great Nations are inviron'd with, againſt the approaches of it, ſo far as it has come within their notice; as among <hi>Jews, Turks,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> are a very obvious Reaſon, why they receive not the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Goſpels free promulgation.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What then is the immediate Reaſon, why ſo many Nations that have the Light of Nature to guide them, and the <hi>Jews</hi> that have the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament, have been the one great Enemies to all Scripture Revelations, and the other to the new Teſtament?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe Nations, that have the light of Nature, ſtay not themſelves upon that which is clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Divine and Publick in Natures Law, but either by unnatural Collections, and miſerable wreſtings of its Principles, or flying to falſe and dark Revelations, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves in falſhood, or miſapplyed Truth: As to the <hi>Jews;</hi> it is very plain, they were bemiſted with the private Interpretation they had affixed to the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65165:185"/> ſo that they could not ſee the clear, eaſie, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Trains of the ſame Publick and Divine, running be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Old</hi> and the <hi>New;</hi> but the Rudiments in the <hi>Old</hi> being more kind to the Cabal or Cypher of their ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted Senſe, they venerated them, and hated the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Life in the <hi>New,</hi> that would not at all bear their privy Gloſs; although both Scriptures had the ſame Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials from Heaven, and carried the ſame Publick Senſe: So great is the Deluſion of Private.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how comes it to paſs, that even among thoſe that enjoy the Light of the Goſpel, the Scriptures, and profeſs the ſame Chriſtianity, nay, the moſt Refined and Reformed Chriſtianity, there are ſo great Differences and Diviſions?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> All proceeds from the ſame unhappy Spring; Men cannot endure to reſt in the Clear and Certain Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Truth, but by forc'd Additions, Miſinterpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, violent Detorſions, forſake that which is Publick and Divine, for that which is Private, and their own; and are greatly offended, and too often enraged, that others do not concur with them.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>It ſeems then, the beſt Method of keeping off from Errour, is to reſt upon the moſt undoubted Points of Truth, before we remove from them to any thing further?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is undoubtedly ſo; Religion, in all the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it, having ſuffered much more by forreign and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable Additions, than by wary Suſpenſions: For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man keeps himſelf from Falſe Religion; and ſtands ready and open to receive Truth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how then ſhould a Man make forward from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion to Revealed, or from what he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, to what he may in time come to ſee very good Proof for?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By ſtaying the due time upon the Uncontrover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Doctrines and Commands of Natures Laws, yielding full Obedience to God in them, trembling to add any
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65165:185"/> thing of baſer Alloy to them. A Man ſhall ſee Revealed Truth ſhining out upon Natural, and joyning it ſelf to it, and with it. Thus many of the Fathers came over to Chriſtianity: And ſo in all parts of Scripture, by riſing from the moſt Fundamental Truths, lov'd and obey'd, a Man ſhall aſcend by due degrees to thoſe more remote. Thus Good Men in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> waited for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and upon juſt Conſiderations moved upon the Line of Truth, from the State of Religion in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> to that of the <hi>New;</hi> except ſometimes a Light ſhines ſuddenly round about Men, as in extraordinary Converſions.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>You ſeem then to think, Falſe Religion, and All Diviſions in the True, have moſt nearly ſprung up from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confidence of Things, not of the Evidence of Publick and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do ſo indeed, although I know Mens not liking to retain Truth, but being bewitched by falſe Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betrays them both to the Plague of Loſt and Fallen Spirits, warring under the Prince of our diſordered Air, <hi>the Ruler of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> and to the various Arts of Men, who corrupt Religion for the Ends they have to ſerve themſelves of by it. I know Mens Faculties of Search, Inquiry into, and Comprehenſion of Truth, are much ſhrivell'd and ſhrunk up; I know Endleſs Doubts and Incertainties are brought upon Religion, by Darkneſs, and falſe Appearances to Souls, that are ſo full of all the Reaſons and Cauſes of Deluſion within themſelves, and deſerted by the juſt Judgment of God, giving them over to believe a Lie; I acknowledge all theſe Cauſes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: Yet I am aſſured, the cloſe Adherence to God in Truths evidently Divine, and not removing farther into a Religious Eſteem of Things, till upon the ſame Evidence, is the Means, under the Conduct of the Holy Spirit, to be ſecure from dangerous Errour or Schiſm from the true
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65165:186"/> Publick: And whatever is not ſo evidently Publick and Divine, is liable to Private Interpretation, and ſo to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: And when Men are overweening upon Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, they eaſily fall into Errour; and when they are ſurly and maſterly upon it, it moves Wrath, Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Strife; ſo that both Falſhoood and Cruelty have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in at this Door, and rang'd over the World.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But ought we to ſtupifie all Inquiry, and benumb Judgment, in every thing not evidently Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo; but to behave our ſelves humbly, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly; to acknowledge there are vaſt Tracts of Truth and Knowledge beyond what we know; but we muſt feel the Evidence of them, before we can receive them: yet to carry our ſelves with due conceſſion to every Mans Senſe, that though their Senſe cannot, nor ought to maſter us, no more ought we to expect ours ſhould them: which would exceedingly reconcile or abate Differences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench the miſchievous Effects the World hath ſo long groan'd under by ſo many Religions of Nations, Names of Churches, and Perſons propagating their Private, that is, not Divine Senſe, and that with Clamour, and too often with rude Force.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What are the Inſtances of the Miſchief of making Defection from this Publick, Catholik, Divine Truth, for Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Senſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Angels Fall from Heaven was certainly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Private Senſe and Intereſt; <hi>Adam</hi>'s from Innocency and Paradiſe, upon the ſame; the <hi>Jews</hi> Fall from being the Church and People of God, was upon the Idiotiſm of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Religion for their own: All Idolatry and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Heathens</hi> have riſen from hence: All the Hereſies in the Church have come from an over-love to Private Opinion. This is the moſt damnable Antichriſtianiſm of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make its Private, Catholick. All Perſecutions of Heathens, <hi>Romes Inquiſition,</hi> and Maſſacres, have been
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65165:186"/> inflam'd in this Furnace, the love of making Private, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And in leſſer and more unfundamental Points, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interpretation enfore'd, as if it were Publick, hath diſcompos'd the Peace of the Pureſt and beſt reformed Churches, and not only diſturb'd their Peace, but ſtain'd their Purity.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>I ſeem to my ſelf in all this unhappy <hi>Babeliſm,</hi> or Confuſion of Religion, to be very apprehenſive for the Glory of God, and Religion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is moſt neceſſary to be zealous for Divine Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for the Honour of Religion; that Rivers of Tears ſhould run down our Eyes, becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Injuries done by Men to the Divine Law: But yet to be ſo concern'd, as to be ſcandaliſed, is to forget that God is infinitely more the Publick, than we are; and therefore to be offended at his Diſpoſes, is to make our Private the Publick. We muſt then conſider, that if God does not miraculouſly interpoſe, it muſt needs be ſo, it is no other than the Neceſſity of the Caſe, Men moving with ſo great Diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, as the Active Soul of Man does in ſo great a Concern as Religion is, in our higheſt Intereſt: and as thereupon Men will make uſe of it in the preſent World, it muſt needs be ſo: There muſt be Hereſies in Religion. But that this <hi>Mormo,</hi> or dreadful Apparition, may vaniſh, we muſt remember, 1. That to the Soul humble, and fearing God, all that is of Grand Intereſt in Faith, Worſhip, and Practice is ſo Publick, and evidently Divine, that no Man need <hi>be ever learning, and never come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi> After this God hath given this Employment to thoſe that through Office or Deſire ſet themſelves to ſeek and intermeddle with al Knowledge, to travel with advantage to themſelves, and others, in their Inquiries into the whole Compaſs of Divine Knowledge; whatever Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty can be ſuppoſed to be in things of higher Advance to Salvation, is reſolv'd to them, that do the Will of God,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65165:187"/> as a Reward of their Obedience; <hi>They ſhall know the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines that are of God,</hi> that riſe higher towards Heaven than others.</p>
                     <p>The due and diligent Search after Wiſdom, is a Teſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the truly Sincere, and well-reſolv'd in Religion, that have in them <hi>another Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Caleb, to follow God fully,</hi> and do not, as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> bring up an ill Report on this good Land, as if the Difficulties were unconquerable, and the Entertainment Hungry and Barren, through the many Diſputes and Differences in Religion.</p>
                     <p>Hereby, laſtly, the Conduct of the Free Spirit is ſeen, <hi>leading into all Truth;</hi> and the Unction of the Holy One, by which the True Chriſtian knows all things neceſſary to him to be known, appears moſt deſirable and neceſſary. Thus the Wiſe and Holy Government of God, who brings Light out of theſe Clouds and Darkneſs, is made manifeſt; and it is to be aſcribed to the Infinite <hi>Perfection of Light,</hi> with the <hi>Father of Lights, who is without any variation, or ſhadow of turning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Rule is then to be obſerved in the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of Men in Religion, that may moſt abound to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Catholick Religion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To own and embrace any thing we find in any Man, or Society of Men, that is truly Catholick, if it be but according to the Light of Natural Religion; to joyn with them in the Performance of any of ſuch Services, ſo far as they will admit it, and keep to the Simplicity and Sincerity of them, according to the Inſtances before-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, of <hi>Jonah</hi> and <hi>St. Paul:</hi> And much more ſhould we do this, when True Revealed Religion is joyned with Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, if nothing be requir'd of us that corrupts and defiles it: No Man's Errour, in which we are not forced to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, ſhould drive us from Truth, or any part of it: And upon theſe Foundations we ſhould endeavour to win fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further upon all, to bring them home to God, wherein they wander.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65165:187"/>
                     <p> We ſhould make Allowances to every Man, differing in ſmaller things, receiving him without conditioning him to ſubſcribe to us, in things of Doubtful, that is, Private Diſputation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If any one erre from the Truth, and one convert him</hi> by Evidences of that Truth, <hi>let him know, that he that converts a Sinner from the errour of his way, ſhall ſave a Soul from Death, and hide a Multitude of Sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if we cannot be admitted to ſuch Communions with thoſe that are ſo enſlav'd to Falſe, or would bring us under the power of Private, or will have nothing to do with us, nor admit us to them; we muſt not yet deſert our Catholick Reſpect to all that is True and Good among them, but acknowledging what is ſo, value and praiſe it, deſire the Divine Acceptance for them in any Good thing, ſo as to bring them out of the Errours they have adjoyned to it, and, as you have opportunity, reaſon them out of the one by the Evidence of the other.</p>

                        <hi>CAP. V.</hi> Of the Publick or Divine Original of Sacred Writing, or Scripture.</head>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>SEeing Scripture is the only Publick Record of True, Pure, Natural Religion, and more eminently of Revealed; it is moſt neceſſary to be fully informed in all Points concerning it: And firſt, What Care God hath been pleaſed to take, that his Word, and purely that, ſhould be committed to Writing?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God held the Hands and Pens of Holy Men, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65165:188"/> an efficacious overſhadowing their Minds, and conducting all their Motions, that they could not erre: In ſome things he ſo fully poſſeſſed their Underſtandings and Affections with a full Knowledge and Senſe of what they were to reveal, that they could not ſo much as muſe any thing Strange or Diverſe from what they were ſo carried and born by the Divine Spirit in, even as <hi>Elijah</hi> in his Body.</p>
                     <p>In other things, wherein they could not look round about them, nor fully comprehend what the Spirit in them did ſignifie, though they convey'd it to After-times, yet they were by Almighty Impreſſions upon all their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties neceſſary to that Service, held in ſtronger than Adamantine Conſinements, that they could not extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from Divine Truths. Even <hi>Balaam,</hi> thus overpower'd againſt his will, <hi>could not go beyond the Word of the Lord, to ſpeak either Good or Evil,</hi> upon the greateſt Reward; much leſs Holy Men, whoſe Wills were perfectly reſigned to the Divine Will.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But was not there a Poſſibility, thoſe Holy Men, Writers of Scripture, might at other times, when the Spirit was not ſo immediately preſent to them, alter, or add of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alloy, to what themſelves had been the Inſtruments of conveying from God to the World? Or might not Pretenders ariſe, and give out Falſe Scripture to the World, that had none of that True Spirit?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> When once any Part of Divine Teſtimony was committed to Writing, it became a Boundary to thoſe very Penmen (much more to all others) that they were always concluded by it: So that beſides the Dread and Awe of God, and of the great Sin of Falſification of his Truth or Name, they could not alter any thing, ſo as to diſagree with what they had before ſpoken by the Divine Spirit, whoſe Righteous Judgments endure for ever: nor could they ſo much as imitate themſelves, when unaſſiſted by the Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65165:188"/>
                     <p> When therefore they did not underſtand by immediate Aſſiſtance, the utmoſt End and Reach of what themſelves were enabled to ſpeak and write, they did (and they could do no more) ſearch, and pronounce by all the beſt ordinary Helps God afforded them, but could change nothing, could add nothing; they ſearched what, or what manner of Time the Spirit of Chriſt in them did ſignifie; they could not pronounce of the Time, when not revealed to them: They knew the dreadful <hi>Anathema</hi> ready to fall, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>an Angel from Heaven,</hi> that ſhould <hi>preach another Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</hi> The leaſt <hi>Iota,</hi> once eſtabliſhed by Unchangeable Wiſdom and Goodneſs, was leſs movable than <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> and would bear no Addition, but of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by which it ſelf was given.</p>
                     <p>And even the very Manner, Method, Words, as they meet to carry ſuch a Senſe, have their Majeſty and Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that whatever was by Inſpiration from God, bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled that which was not; and they that were inſpir'd, knew in what they were inſpir'd, and what they ſpoke as ſo inſpired, and in what they were not; but were as <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> with his Locks cut, no more than <hi>like other Men;</hi> and moſt cautiouſly diſtinguiſh'd betwixt the one and the other. Nothing therefore hath aſſayed to joyn it ſelf to Scripture; if any hath dar'd to do it, it hath been reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by it, when not of the High and Publick Spirit of it.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But did not the Writers of the New Teſtament reverſe the Writings and Commands of the Old; which thing ſo ſcandaliſed the Jews againſt our Lord, his Diſciples, and Goſpel?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No otherwiſe than as the Sun commands the Shadow to fly away, and the leſſer Lights to retire, when it ſelf appears; or the things typ'd out being come, make uſeleſs the Types, ſo that they neceſſarily give place, or, as Pictures vail when the Life is preſent: Elſe there was ſuch a Reſpect to the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65165:189"/> thoſe of the <hi>New,</hi> as to avow them of God before them, and Elder Scripture than themſelves: ſo that they vouch'd them for all they ſaid and taught, and ſtaid the time of themſelves being tried, proved, and ſufficiently confirmed, and Canonized into Scripture, by the Scriptures that were undoubtedly ſo before them, and in the very ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that they came into the Honour of being Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Upon which account, the Apoſtle calls them the <hi>more ſure Word of Propheſie; more ſure,</hi> becauſe of greater An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and Elder Reception into Scripture, than that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical Relation and Doctrine, which yet was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſs into Scripture of the ſame Authority and Value with former Scripture, and of greater Evidence and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Clearneſs, and recommended by Higher Appearances of Divinity.</p>
                     <p>And on this ſame account the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> derives it ſelf from the <hi>Old,</hi> ſometimes by Proofs out of it, drawn according to the moſt regular Trains and Conſequences; ſometimes by more immediate and autho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there no other Rule of Religion then, but the Scriptures, embracing the Law of Nature?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There can be none, except either Religion were not derived wholly from God, and therefore not ſo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick as we have aſſerted it, or except any other Record of Religion can ſhew its Deſcent as High and Publick as Scripture does: Of which Proof which Scripture gives of it ſelf, and what it is, Inquiry is in the next place to be made.</p>

                        <hi>CAP. VI.</hi> Of the Proof of Scripture, That it is of God; and that the Proof alſo is Publick and Divine.</head>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>WHat kind of Proof of ſo Divine a Record as Scripture, is high enough to prove it to be ſo Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which is, even as the Original of Scripture, Divine alſo.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why muſt the Proof or Evidence of Scripture be Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is below the Dignity of Divine, to receive its principal Proof from Private, or lower than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Publick.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Becauſe nothing but Divine can ſo reach the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as to fill and poſſeſs it with ſatisfactory Evidence in ſo great a Concernment as Religion, nor ſtrikes the Heart
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65165:190"/> with thoſe great Effects of Love to, Fear of, Joy in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Word of God, ſo eſſential to Religion, but Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: <hi>When ye received the Word of God, ye received it not as the Word of Men, but as it is in Truth the Word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is impoſſible what is truly Divine ſhould not dart the Rays of Divinity, as all other Things of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency ſend out the Beams of that Excellency they have, and thereby diſcover themſelves; For, we know all things eſpecially by themſelves. The Light remonſtrates it ſelf by it ſelf. The <hi>Genius</hi> of every Writer ſhews it ſelf firſt by it ſelf. We ſee the Divineneſs of Creation, and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, by themſelves. Beſt and Greateſt is ſelf-evidently Divine; and whatever it is written upon, is evidently Divine alſo.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How does Scripture ſhew it ſelf thus Divine?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By a Majeſtick Aſſumption to it ſelf to be Divine, it ſpeaks ſo in and of all things it ſpeaks, and as it pleaſes effects as Divine only does and can effect, and is the Beſt and Greateſt Record of Truth to all Holy and Wiſe Minds: The only extant inviolate Record of Natural and Revealed Religion in the World, is Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is Ratiocination then, or the Juſt Compaſs Reaſon goes, to be neglected concerning Scriptures?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By no means: For when theſe Self-evidences of every thing have ſtruck us earlier than our Scrutinies of Reaſon, and its Inqueſt can be performed about them; that they may neither appear Fancies to us on our ſecond Thoughts, nor we run into Miſtake concerning them by the Power of Imagination, there is then liberty for Reaſon to inquire further, and aſſure it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Nor will the Evidence hereupon amount to leſs than Divine; For, Divine only can ſatisfie the Reaſon that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, and like it ſelf, inquires into Divine.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What then are the great Aſſurances to Reaſon, of the Divinity of Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:65165:190"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I account this the Chief; That there are Two great Volumes, the Book of the Natural Law of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, written upon the Heart, and engraven in the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the Book of Scripture: That both theſe are addreſſed purely to the Mind, as abſtracted from Senſe: That each of them is Counterparted by Two great Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of Divinity to Senſe, which Senſe is Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, or Mind acting in and by Body. Theſe two are either Ordinary or Conſtant, as Creation, Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Providence; or Extraordinary, as Miracles: That each of them have alſo two Executive Powers, acting them to their Ends; The Motions and Activities of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, inabled by the conſtant Concourſe of General Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and the Supernatural Illuminations and Motions of the Divine Spirit: And that all theſe agree in one, unite with, and fortifie one another; all of them carrying the Evidences of Divine Preſence, and filling all the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſiveneſs of our Faculties concerning God, that he is in them: ſo that nothing is Divine in the whole World, the contrary of which we may feel, or Scripture is Divine.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But what is to be allowed to Conſent of Hiſtory, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Tradition, and Education, in the Belief of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> All that can be deſired to be allowed; for it ſpeaks the Abſolute Sovereignty of God, in making uſe of whom and what he pleaſes, in introducing his Word into any Parts of the World, and contriving the Teſtimony of Men as preparatory to the Teſtimony from himſelf, which is much greater; even as our Saviour received the Service of <hi>John</hi>'s Teſtimony, but had much higher; or as Reaſon may receive from Senſe ſome accidental Teſtimonies.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But is there not much more to be yielded to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Aſſurance, that ſuch Hiſtorians as the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Inſpired Writers, of ſuch Honeſty and Integrity, would not prevaricate, nor give any falſe Account of Things,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65165:191"/> of the Miracles wrought by themſelves or our Saviour, of the Doctrines of Chriſtianity, or of their Divine Original; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they ſeal'd all theſe with the Contempt of all things in this World, even of Life it ſelf, and died in the conſtant Affirmation of them; which remov'd all baſe Deſigns far from them, even the ſuſpicion of it?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Proofs of the Doctrine and Divine Deſcent of Scripture, are undoubtedly of the higheſt Account that any Created Teſtimony can be, and are a down-weight of Proof to all ſober Reaſon: Yet that they can riſe above the Value of <hi>John Baptiſt</hi>'s Teſtimony to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I cannot find; and therefore we muſt remove higher to the Doctrines that thoſe Holy Men preach'd and writ, the ſpiritual Wiſdom and admirable Contexture they us'd in Writing, the Works they did, carrying the Evidences of Divinity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and applied by the Holy Spirit to the Senſes of true Believers, with its own aſſuring Atteſtations, and gracious Operations: of which, all that was but created is no more than the Tube, Pipe, or Channel of Conveyance, if we enter it into a compare with what is Higher and Divine.</p>
                     <p>But if the laſt Reſolution of Proof were into any thing Humane, there might be miſtake in that; for Humane at its higheſt elevation is but Created, and Created is not firm and ſure enough for a Foundation, nor can it raiſe an Aſſent noble and generous enough for a Faith in that which is Divine. All that can be ſummon'd, may be an outward Fortification or Introduction; but the Rock of Truth is the Son of God, Divinity it ſelf: Upon this <hi>the Church is built, that the Gates of Hell cannot prevail againſt it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But are there no Parts of Scripture that receive greater Service from Humane Teſtimony, than others?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are ſome Parts of Scripture that are but Miniſterial, and almoſt Servile, in compariſon of others. And that theſe are found in all Authentick Copies, and have been delivered down from Age to Age with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65165:191"/> Rolls, may depend more upon Humane Teſtimony, eſpecially where the Connexion with the more Divine Parts is not evident: For theſe being but as the Body, and ſome of them of the more remote Parts from the Soul of Scripture, cannot ſparkle that Divine Light and Heat the Spirit of Scripture does, and ſo may ſtand in need of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed Light from the Superiour Luminaries of Sacred Truth, and in many Caſes may, like the Moon, need Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions of Light from our very Earth; but the Sun of Scripture receives the Higheſt Teſtimony, by the ſtrongeſt Reflexions of its own Original Beams.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How comes it to paſs, that there are ſuch different Degrees of Scripture-Excellency in the ſeveral Parts of it, and that it is not one Even Form of Doctrine, methodically laid together, and of the ſame Tenour of Diſcourſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this ſeeming Diſorder appears the great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Majeſty of Divine Contrivance, that without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging it ſelf to the low and even pedantick Laws of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Diſcourſe, it raiſes ſo great a Record of Truth upon variety of Occaſions, and by an Infinite Foreſight prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to it ſelf the ſeveral Meaſures and Ends of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, raiſes them out of a great variety of Accidents, and in ſuch an Order as ſeem'd beſt to it ſelf for thoſe Ends, ſo as to give eaſie and ready Advantages to him that runs to read, and gather Inſtructions of weightieſt moment, and alſo of quickeſt and ſuddeneſt ſally upon his Mind, of greateſt aptneſs to fix upon the Memory without loading it, and yet in the mean time to lay the Obligations of all Degrees of Search and Diligence to join one part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to another, ſo as to comprehend the whole Complex of Divine Doctrine, and extract the Order of Hiſtory. For by a moſt natural, free, and unaffected occaſional way, all Truths to make <hi>wiſe to Salvation,</hi> and a complete Sum of all Goodneſs, is to be found in Scripture, with infinite Varieties of Addreſs, all the ways poſſible, to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65165:192"/> Will, Affections, Conſcience, Memory, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuited to all Capacities, States, Conditions, full of plain and obvious, of moſt retir'd, ſecret, and fartheſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd Wiſdom, which no Mind can fully graſp, nor Tongue expreſs.</p>
                     <p>And with theſe Things of main Importance, runs along ſuch a Chronology of the Dealings of God with the World, and eſpecially with his Church, as ſerves the main Deſign. All Learning and Knowledge in the mean time attending with lowlieſt Submiſſion, and not with pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Appearance.</p>
                     <p>Now from this Supreme Diſpoſe of all things to the Ends of God in Scripture, out of ſuch a variety of Emergencies of all ſorts, ariſes ſuch a diverſity of ſeveral Excellencies in the Parts of Scripture, that yet all meet in that Great Center of the Glory of God, in a Communication of his Counſels concerning Man, and that turn round thoſe Two Globes, that little one of the preſent World, a Point like this Earth, and the other that vaſt Circumference of Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But is there not as great a difference ariſing from the various States and Conditions of the Writers of Scripture, and the ſo different Periods of Time they were upon?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there is, and muſt needs be a difference, is undeniable; yet, to the great Glory of Scripture, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance it is from God, even thoſe ſmalleſt and loweſt things laſt ſpoken of are all treated with all the Purity, Gravity, becoming the Penmen of the Holy Spirit, and with all the Uſefulneſs their Nature can extend to; Even ſo the Holy Men uſed by God in this Service, how vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and differing ſoever in their ſeveral Ages and Times of writing, in their Circumſtances of State and Condition in this World, High, Low, Rich, Poor, Learned, Unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how diſtant ſoever in their Times of Writing, in the outward Forms and Modes of their Worſhip of God, in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65165:192"/> Things that fell under their Account and Relation, before the Law, under the Law, in the Days of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> after his Death; yet there is the ſame Spirit, Scope, Chaſtneſs of Style, Majeſty, and Authority in the Contexture; one Aſpect upon the Glory of God, Obedience to him, Deſire of his Favour, as the whole Happineſs of Man; the ſame Reflexions upon the great Evil of Sin, and the conſequent Miſery, and even of their own Sins: So that where any Combination, or Conference to concert things, was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, yet there is ſuch an Union without a ſet Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as aſſures the One Hand of the Divine Spirit and Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon All.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not the Church of God the Truſtee and Depoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Sacred Oracles?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo in Divine Ordination, and the general Courſe of Providence; but yet it adds nothing to them, but receives all from them. The Church is known to be the Church by the Scriptures, not the Scriptures by the Church, except declaratorily only. The Church is the Pillar and Reſt of Scriptures, where God is pleas'd to fix them, that they may be expoſed to Publick View; but their Authority is of God, evident in themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Do we then attribute nothing more to the Church, in which we were Baptiz'd, and received the Knowledge of Religion?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A very great Favour it is of God, that when he writes up the People, he counts that we were born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his True Church, where all the Springs of Salvation run: but as to the Proof of Religion, or the Records of it, it can be no more than a Private Proof: For, till we make a true Judgment, by what is Divine and Publick, and of God in the true Church, it does no more than equal other Societies walking with Confidence and Aſſurance, with great Awes and Devotion, in the Name of their God, in the Profeſſion of their Religion. Till therefore there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65165:193"/> is a Trial of every Religion, and the Records of it, all ſuch Societies are upon the ſame Level. When the Religion, and Oracles of every Religion, come to be tried, and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, the Church of God riſes to Heaven, and all elſe, except ſo far as they joyn in any Parts of the ſame Truth, ſink down beneath.</p>
                     <p>Queſt: <hi>But how can we know that every Book of Scripture is Scripture, but by the Teſtimony of the Church? or, that we have all the Books of it, but by the ſame Teſtimony?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Books we own for Scripture are Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all of them ſo, ariſes to our Aſſurance by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Divine Spirit of Truth running through one, as does through another: For, upon this account the True Church received them, when firſt received, and ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, making the ſame Judgment ſucceſſively in the ſeveral Ages, as the firſt did, the ſame Reaſon always continuing. What is beſides this, is to be attributed to the Diſcerning of Spirits in all the Times while Scripture was writing, by the due Exerciſe of which True Scripture was received, and all other ſhut out: for, the Writings of Prophets was ſubject to Prophets, and by them enroll'd into Scriptures. That we have the ſame Scripture juſtly and faithfully conſigned over to us from Age to Age, is to be own'd and acknowledg'd to Divine Providence watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over his Church and Oracles together, and conveying to us by the ordinary Security of the Churches Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the <hi>Precious</hi> diſtinguiſh'd not only <hi>from the Vile,</hi> but from the <hi>leſs Precious</hi> alſo: but yet we muſt have greater Teſtimony than this, as hath been already urged.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how could we be aſſured we have all the Scripture, were it not for the Churches Teſtimony?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Finding ſo much Divine, and no more of the ſame ſtamp in the World, we may be concluded that way, and abundantly ſatisfied, that God will accept us in our Faith and Obedience to ſo great a Revelation. When any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65165:193"/> of Divine Truth hath been adhered to ſincerely, the Danger hath always been greater in loſing True Religion by corrupt Additions; and the injurious Refuſals of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Revelation come to paſs more through the Prejudices of that Corruption, than by humble and modeſt Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till God hath aſſured us of his further Revelations. But beſides this, we may eaſily find, we muſt needs have the whole Globe of Truth, and the Horizon of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel gives us the whole Heaven or Kingdom of it, as it is adminiſtred in this World; ſo that all further Degrees of Light, and Diſcoveries of it, ſhall be but greater Clearneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of what we already have in the main and Subſtance: For, if even the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> though it made ſo great a change, did but thus compleat and illuſtrate Chriſt <hi>yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and to day the ſame,</hi> how much more may we be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, who have the <hi>New</hi> it ſelf, ſo much excelling the <hi>Old,</hi> as it every where aſſures us? So that we can expect a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium,</hi> or the <hi>New Hieruſalem</hi> on Earth, only for the higheſt Exaltation of what we now have, till we come to Heaven it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Do the various Readings, ſo often bandied by Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Men, make no Abatement from the Certainty of Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe various Readings are ſuch as excite and quicken Search, and yet cannot diſtract the Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not able to alter the Scope, Coherence, and Deſign of the Context, much leſs to change the Analogie of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in other Places: While therefore they do not that, they take away the ſuſpicion of Conſpiracy, they preſerve from greater Corruptions, by turning the Eyes of Men to look every way; they ſhew how many excellent Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes dwell near the Divine Writing, and the Bad are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly enough thrown off: For in main things there is ſo much repeated, and ſaid over again and again, as that all ſuch Truths may be fully preſented and aſſured, and yet not ſo much be ſaid, as might be ſaid of the ſame kind,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65165:194"/> without any Tautology; for the Subjects are ſo rich, that even the World would be over-charg'd, and <hi>not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Books that would be written. Amen.</hi>

That the Aſſurance and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture is very near us, when we come to treat with it; ſo that we need not ſend up to Heaven, that were to bring Scripture down from above, when it is come down already; nor beyond the Sea, to oldeſt Antiquity, for a Scale to it, which hath always the Broad Seal of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity with it; for that were to bring Scripture a ſecond time from the Apoſtles and former Ages, through which

Interpretation of Scripture thus guiding it ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the evident Senſe of Scripture, in its cleareſt Parts, and taking that as a Clew into the more abſtruſe Parts of Scripture, neceſſarily encounters much Sound and excellent Truth, nearly allied to Publick and Divine, in all Knowledge, Natural, Hiſtorical, Chronological, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, Political, pertaining to Language and Eloquence, which makes the World more lightſom, and leſs ſubject to the Tyranny of the <hi>Prince of Darkneſs.</hi> How great a Light of all Learning hath broken out from the very Endeavours of Interpreting Scripture, to the Glory of the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> the high Honour and venerable Eſtimation of Scripture, the much Aſcertaining True Publick Religion, and the Univerſal Good!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Many great Truths, and undoubtedly Divine in themſelves, that, being more at a diſtance from thoſe that are neceſſary to Salvation, it hath not pleaſed the Publick Wiſdom of the World to give ſuch Aſſurance of them, as that they ſhould be impoſed upon the Belief of all that acknowledge the Sacred Authority of Scriptures, and yet may preſent very large Satisfactions to the Minds of thoſe who are aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit, into the great Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Reaſon, in ſuch Points, though but particularly for themſelves: They may then <hi>taſte the Graciouſneſs of God,</hi> and the Gratefulneſs of Truth in them, without impoſing on any others, who cannot ſee by their Light.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>All this that hath been deſcribed, I confeſs, agrees with ſo Publick and Catholick a Record as Scripture is: A Record, wherein every one that comes to it, may ſearch his own Intereſt and Concern in it, and improve it to the utmoſt: A Record that offers and expoſes it ſelf to be underſtood and cloſely inquired into by all.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Herein it is ſecure; 1. That Scripture is not of any Interpretation, but its own native Senſe: It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of any other: It ſtands free, and clear, far above all Interpretation of Men, to be conſidered by any one in it ſelf, and not under ſuch Interpretation. Such Interpretation does not become Scripture, nor bind any

This is the Freedom of Scripture, to ſuffer all due approaches to its Senſe. This is its moſt ſevere Conſtancy to refuſe all, but its own true Senſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As Scripture is not of any Interpretation, but its own Native Senſe, ſo its Senſe is of no other Evidence, but of Spiritual Divine, and truly Rational Evidence; ſo that if any Man does not bring ſuch proofs of Scripture Senſe, as agree with Scriptures way of Evidencing it ſelf; and Scriptures way is not that of Private Authority, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Impoſition, but of Divine Authority and Preſence; his Interpretation, however true, yet does not bind, as it is his Interpretation, or upon any other Recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Scriptures proper ways of recommending it ſelf: <hi>I ſpeak as to Wiſe Men, judge ye what I ſay.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What then is that Private Interpretation the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle remonſtrates againſt?</hi>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65165:200"/> Interpretation, and adding to Scripture, making ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture, <hi>which yet is not another.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus are all lower Degrees of this Tyranny to be eſtimated, according to their ſeveral Graduations in it; impoſing upon Men, as from ſome Scriptural Authority, what is not of the True Excellency, Spirit, and High Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of Scripture, nor manifeſted in Mens Conſciences, as Scripture manifeſts it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is it not then neceſſary, in regard of the Confuſion ariſing from the variouſneſs and incertainty of every Man In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting for himſelf, and without certain Divine Evidence, that there ſhould be ſome Infallible Publick Interpreter, ſo Divinely aſſiſted as you deſcribe? And is it not reaſonable to believe there is ſuch a one, ſeeing we cannot ſuppoſe God is wanting to his Church in ſuch a Neceſſary?</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. When there comes ſuch an Infallible Interpreter, bearing the Seal of ſuch Credentials, as the Scripture does, we will receive him. Till ſuch an Interpreter, ſo arm'd, comes to us, we are never the better for his Pretence to Infallibility; But all that receive him are deſtroyed by him, when he brings Falſhood for Truth under ſo great a Title; ſo that he becomes more an <hi>Apollyon,</hi> or Deſtroyer of the Church, than an open Enemy can be.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Muſt we not then neceſſarily ſuppoſe great Tracts of Scripture lying like unknown Land, for want of Publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation?</hi>

                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65165:200"/>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Expectation is there of a Full and Certain Publick Interpretation of all ſuch Scriptures?</hi>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Seeing by all that hath been ſaid, it appears, how incongruous Private Interpretation is to Publick Scripture, or that the Will of Man ſhould be truſted with the one, and not with the other; What Account therefore can be given of Tranſlations? May not they bring in a Private Interpretation upon Scripture, if not performed by an immediate Divine Aſſiſtance?</hi>

He hath been pleaſed to order the Conveyance of Scriptures into ſo many Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by raiſing up many to travel in the Knowledge of all Tongues, and the Keys of them, as in the Originals, to find out their Meaning, and to transfuſe them into all other Languages, and that, by ſo many, of ſeveral Ages and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as makes all Combination to deceive, impoſſible; and Univerſal Deception, next to impoſſible, upon the Tranſlators themſelves. Theſe things are under his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Care: It is enough to us, there is brought to our Knowledge ſuch an excellent Doctrine, riſing out of ſo many Divine Sayings and Diſcourſes, that are as ſo many Stars in the Firmament of Truth, clear as the Luminaries of that name in the Heavens. Why ſhould we then be more than modeſtly and humbly concerned to know all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65165:201"/> the Ages they have paſs'd through before they came to us, or all the Secrets concerning their Motion and Appearance, that he onely knows, that <hi>calls the Stars by their Names?</hi> It is enough, they evidently and undeniably declare God to us, and aſſure us by their Light, by their regular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on according to the Laws of Truth and Goodneſs, that they are Stars, the Greater and the Leſſer <hi>differing one from another in Glory,</hi> yet all Stars, and of a truly Divine Luſtre, Certain, and not Wandring.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Let us now hear the Concluſion of this whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It reſts in theſe two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the Evidences of the Divine Preſence in the Scriptures, and all the principal Branches thereof, are as clear and certain, and do ſatiate the Soul and its Faculties, inlightned by the general Influences of the Divine Spirit, much more by its ſanctifying Efficacy, even as the cleareſt Notions we have of Things do, and much above them: And that theſe Evidences are the ſame in the Original Scriptures, and in the Tranſlations, for that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed All Original, and not capable of any Tranſlation, but make even Tranſlation an Original.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That as Scripture is ſuch a Contexture, and makes up ſuch a Book, God, the ſupreme Governour of the Church, and of the World in general, hath always, and does always take care of its preſervation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from ſuch Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions as would injure thoſe Evidences of Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration he hath ingraven upon it, not only upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but upon the very Contexture; and the very ſame care he hath taken for the Conveyance of it, by agreeable Tranſlations, to the ſeveral Nations in their own Tongue, to whom he hath vouchſafed the Scriptures themſelves, or the Doctrine of them.</p>

Seventy two Seniors of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as Hiſtory moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally agrees, the Learnedeſt in their Native <hi>Hebrew,</hi> were employed in it. This Tranſlation was generally and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly received among the <hi>Jews,</hi> was approved by our Lord and his Apoſtles in ſeveral Quotations.</p>
                     <p>Hereby there was at once a Preparation of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the moſt Publick Notice, an Aſſurance of the true Import of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and an authoriſed Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation: And in the ſame ſo known <hi>Greek</hi> Language, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are repoſed ſuch Treaſures of all Literature, is added that moſt Sacred Roll of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>BY what hath been ſaid, Scripture and its Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation appear guarded by their own Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt all Private and Counterfeit, as by <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and a Flaming Sword turning every way. But hath there been no Stratagem of the Adverſary to undermine Divine Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, and the Authority of Scripture, the Publick Record of Religion, with its Publick Interpretation; and yet that all theſe ſhould ſeem ſtill to reſt firm upon their own Baſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The great Enemy of God and Truth hath been wanting in no Artifice, and therefore hath fallen upon that very Method inquired of; that what could not be atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by denying Scripture, by bringing in Falſe Scripture, or Private Interpretation, monſtrous to the Text, (all ſuch groſs Frauds being in ſome Times and Places expoſed and exploded) might be more ſucceſsfully attempted and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by yoaking <hi>Tradition</hi> with Scripture, a Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65165:202"/> Oracle with a Publick and Certain one, and ſo avowed to be by the Traditioniſts themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What is</hi> Tradition?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe four things concur to the making up <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That from the Divine Authority of Scriptures, and the True Religion of them, which (as hath been ſaid) it acknowledges, it borrows not only Countenance, but Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and more than that, a ſhew of Reaſon and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That it therefore endeavours to tack and joyn it ſelf to Scripture, and the Religion of it, as neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and fill it up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or to provide ſomething more requiſite to that Religion, that Scripture hath not provided for.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That it having grown up from no true Root, nor riſen upon any juſt Foundation, it hath ſtollen into its Authority and Reverence, by being paſſed from Hand to Hand ſo long, that its Elderlineſs looks like a Patent for that Authority and Reverence: And its Original (ſome Injudicious Devotion, at the beſt) not being eaſie to be trac'd, it comes to be ſuppoſed, or rather ſuperſtitiouſly to be ſuſpected to be Divine; and at length, like a long-told Lie, aſſuming to be Truth, it takes upon it ſelf to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and to curſe all thoſe that derogate from it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That having thus rivetted it ſelf, it by degrees, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Lean Kine, eats out the generous and rich Senſe of Scripture, and devours the Authority of it, and yet it ſelf remains a jejune and ſtarv'd Superſtition.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To <hi>cleave with full purpoſe and reſolution of Heart and Soul</hi> to the Word of God, and to that only; to have no Religion, nor any thing in Religion, but what is enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and recommended by Divine Authority, in that Bleſſed Word of God; and this is indeed to be of the truly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, Apoſtolick, and Publick Religion.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But is the Senſe that hath now been given of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> the beſt Senſe of it in Scripture-uſe?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, it is not; and the Conſideration of a better Senſe will much clear to us the Nature of <hi>Tradition.</hi> When therefore our Saviour diſcourſed of the <hi>Commandments of Men,</hi> delivered down from Hand to Hand, ſubſiſting only upon the Private Authority of the Elders, not founded on the written Canon of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> at that time the only Rule of Faith, Worſhip, and Practice, he always names <hi>Tradition</hi> in the ill Senſe already given: But when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Rules of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> in thoſe grand Points, were juſt breathing from the Holy Spirit, and not yet fixed in that abiding Canon, <hi>Tradition</hi> is ſo long accepted in a good Senſe. The Hiſtory of the Things done by our Saviour, though <hi>moſt ſurely believed, Luc.</hi> 1. 1. was firſt but delivered or <hi>tradition'd</hi> by Word of Mouth, but afterwards written, <hi>that the certainty of them might be more fully known</hi> to thoſe that had been before Catechiz'd in them by <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> All the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the Chriſtian Worſhip were firſt <hi>Traditions,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. and the very <hi>Rules of Life</hi> were in <hi>Tradition,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ</hi> 3. 6.</p>

                     <p>If Tradition then was not ſo ſure in the firſt and truly pure Times of it, how much leſs would it have been ſure afterwards, if it had continued in <hi>Tradition?</hi> All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Doctrine in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was firſt prepared by <hi>Tradition,</hi> laid in and proved by the Scriptures of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> either by direct Conſequence, or by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation from immediate Revelation, demonſtrated, as the Firſt giving of Scripture always was, by Miracles; and ſo all at once, and once for all, conſigned over to the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Chriſtians by Divinely Inſpired Writings, ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, ſo confirmed, as to leave no place for <hi>Tradition</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Even in the time of the Apoſtles it was truſted no longer to <hi>Tradition,</hi> than it muſt needs; for the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> the Survivor of them, cloſed the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that was drawn apace into Writing all along: But at that time there was ſuch a continual immediate Energy or Efficacy of the Holy Spirit, that Truth mov'd every way, like Lightning, and both by its direct and ſtraight forward Motion in Doctrine, and its reverſe ſtrokes in the Conviction of all Falſhood, Errour was blaſted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way: But when this Extraordinary Appearance ceaſed, there was then no ſafety for Truth, but in an unchangeable Written Word, that was in ſuch an extraordinary Seaſon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65165:204"/> of Miracles and immediate Revelation, ſetled and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under ſo great a Superviſal, in the midſt of ſo many Witneſſes of all things, by their Eyes and Ears; and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once written, and always ſo ſecured by Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as hath been repreſented, it always ſpeaks the ſame Things, in the ſame Words it firſt did.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Why might not Divine Truth be committed, ſome more Fundamental Parts to Writing, and ſome, according to variety of Occaſion, to Tradition?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God, to whom all Futurity is preſent, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw all that was neceſſary to be written, before he had done writing cannot be ſuppoſed to commit his Will in part to Writing, and that upon great Reaſons; and the ſame Reaſons notwithſtanding, to leave a conſiderable part, or ſo much as any one Branch obligatory upon the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to <hi>Parol-Tradition:</hi> For, if <hi>he that offends in one Point is guilty of all,</hi> there needs the ſame Authority, and as well aſſured, for one Point of Faith and Obedience, as for all the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It is unconceivable, what End <hi>Tradition,</hi> unconſign'd by Scripture, can ſerve, that Scripture does not more fully and effectually take care for. Publick Religion reſerves nothing to be a Cabal for Private Intereſt, within a cloſe Cabinet or Conclave.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Whatever is ſuppoſed to be entruſted to <hi>Tradition,</hi> muſt either be the very ſame we have in Scripture, and then <hi>Tradition</hi> is needleſs and ſuperfluous; for we have it in Scripture, if we duly exerciſe our ſelves in it: or it is more than Scripture hath declared, and yet ſuppoſed to be of equal Authority with Scripture; and then it muſt be a Motionary and Itinerant Word of God: But where are the daily and continual Seals and Credentials Divine <hi>Tradition</hi> had, and in a conſtant freſh Motion with it, as it moves; for ſo it had need be, in ſo fluid a Thing as <hi>Tradition,</hi> if it would pretend to be Sacred; and ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65165:204"/> Divinely Inſpired Tradition had, while it continued in Tradition: But what Reaſon can be given, Tradition, as we now ſpeak of it, was not incorporated into Scripture, as was argued before? Or that in ſo long a Courſe of Time it hath not been enroll'd into Scripture, as the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles ſtill was? Seeing, if it had all things elſe, it cannot but want the Benefit of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Contexture and Conveyance that Scripture hath, in Words choſen, and put together by Inſpiration, and the ready, eaſie, and certain Acceſs to it by all: For all are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in it. Now ſeeing Tradition wants all theſe, how can we accept it? How can we look off from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to pore upon Tradition? or what hold can we have of it?</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But how can it be, but there muſt be Tradition, ſeeing there were ſo many Things ſpoken and done, more than the Scripture contains, or the World it ſelf could contain, if they were all written? Theſe then being known in the firſt Times, have been conſerv'd by Tradition, Tradition made valuable by thoſe of Honourable Name among Chriſtians, and their Diſcourſes of Chriſtianity?</hi>

                     <p>As for all that Chriſt did and ſpake, or that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſpake or did by Infallible Guidance, and Immediate Aſſiſtance, if it be not written, a Veil is drawn over it, and a <hi>Cloud hath received it out of our ſight:</hi> It is a ſecret thing, that belongs not to us, but is ſealed up from us, like the things which the Thunders uttered in the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And indeed the Wiſdom of Providence ſeems to have dealt with all ſuch Sayings or Actions, as with the Body of <hi>Moſes;</hi> all Monuments of Worth and Certainty, after Scripture, in relation to them, are concealed from us: There is a great Darkneſs upon the Hiſtory of that Time, leſt we ſhould ſuperſtitiouſly venerate, in place of that which is divinely written and preſerved to us, the things that were not prepared for our Learning, and ſo, to us, but as a Body not divinely inſpired, that is, a Body without a Soul. All too fierce Diſputes about them are therefore raiſed only by Sathan, the Enemy of Light and Truth, to no other purpoſe than that about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is, to found an occaſion of Superſtition, and ſilently to whiſper, <hi>Scripture is not ſufficient.</hi> And yet we ſee with what an eager Zeal Men are ſet upon ſuch Reſearches, not ſatisfied with the Proportion of <hi>Manna</hi> allowed by God; but even as the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that <hi>gathered much, had nothing over;</hi> ſo may it be truly ſaid of thoſe that would abound beyond Scripture, in that which pertains to the true gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Conſcience, <hi>That they have nothing over,</hi> and what they will needs keep, as ſuch, corrupts.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there Reaſon ſufficient to ſupport this Sentiment?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This great Reaſon: If we had undoubted, but not inſpired Hiſtory of that Time, it could not be like the <hi>Evangeliſtick Hiſtory,</hi> or the <hi>Actes of the Apoſtles</hi> to us; we ſhould in ſome things want the Application and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our uſe, dictated by Divine Wiſdom; in others, the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65165:205"/> unerring Cenſure of even Apoſtolick Actions, as in that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Galat.</hi> 2. 11. Now becauſe our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences would be apt to be drawn into ſubjection to things of ſo great Reputation, and yet there would be no Divine Authority to draw them, nor Infallible Authority to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them, in which Caſes it is the Abſolute Will of God they ſhould not be in ſubjection, God hath therefore in his Providence left that time ſo much in the dark, that we may truſt in his written Word only.</p>
                     <p>For ſeparate Immediate Divine Preſence from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles themſelves, and there remains nothing at the higheſt, but the Wiſdom and Prudence of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and Good Men, applying General Rules to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes, Times, Places, and Events as they for that time could beſt judge, and yet beſides the variation of Circumſtances in every Age, they themſelves were as Men, ſubject to miſtakes, as <hi>Nathan</hi> about <hi>David</hi>'s building the Temple, as <hi>Paul</hi> aſſaying to go into <hi>Bithynia;</hi> to like Paſſions with other Men, as in the Contention betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> to like Temptations, as in the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of <hi>Peter</hi> before referred to: All they did and ſaid, not ſhining with immediate Light from Heaven, muſt be tried in the Light of what themſelves, together with all the other Penmen of Scripture, had written. They them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therefore acting or ſpeaking by way of Prudence or general Aſſiſtance, muſt be tried by themſelves, acting or ſpeaking according to Revelation, and ſpecial Aſſiſtance, in which only they are and ought to be Authoritative.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But it ſtill remains, There might be ſome things that were not ſo ſit for vulgar Knowledge, and ſo were Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Tradition apart from Scripture, and that Tradition depoſited with Truſty Men, who ſhould ſucceſſively ſo depoſite it, that it might at convenient Seaſons be brought forth, as <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword from behind the <hi>Ephod.</hi>

For, firſt, let theſe Traditionaries give clear Expoſitions, and ſuch as are worthy to be acquieſced in, of the Prophetick, or otherwiſe Dark Places of Scripture. If they cannot do that, where is the Wiſdom above the Vulgar? and why did not Tradition, without Scripture, incloſe thoſe myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Viſions of the <hi>Revelation</hi> from Popular Inſpection? But the things Tradition is imploy'd indeed in, are quite of another Nature; either the Prelation of Men in Church-Office and Dignity, or ſome Rites of Worſhip, that ſhould change Devotion into Superſtition, or lull it into Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; or ſome Canons, that turn Religion into Trade, or Doctrines ſuited to that End; or, which ſerves to all ſuch purpoſes, a Tradition to call back all Scripture out of the Written Word into Oral Tradition, by locking it up in a Tongue unknown to the generality of Chriſtians. And yet if there were any ſeemingly Purer, or more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templational Traditions, ſeeing they are not inrolled into Scripture, they muſt, as hath been ſaid, give ſuch Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of themſelves, as Divine Revelation hath, or be, at their higheſt, but Enthuſiaſm and Fanaticiſm.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But what Eſteem is to be had of the Writings and Iranſactions of the Ancients, whom we call Fathers, Doctors of the Church, Men of eminent Holineſs, great Abilities, Confeſſors, and Martyrs of Chriſtianity?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be eaſily judg'd, by what hath been ſaid already, that they muſt be brought to Scripture, laid at its Feet, and ſubmitted to its Acceptance, whether according to its true Senſe, or not: For, if the Apoſtles, when the Holy Spirit was not upon them, could not exceed Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, how much leſs can any of a lower Claſs pretend? The Fathers therefore had ſo great an Awe of Scripture, that they did not aſſume any thing to themſelves or their Writings, or yield any thing to the Perſons or Writings of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65165:206"/> thoſe of the ſame Time with them, but according to the undeniable Senſe of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But the nearneſs of theſe Fathers to the Days of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, muſt needs enable them, either from what they themſelves received warm from their Lips, or from what they had from others, not quite cold, to know the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine, Diſcipline, Manner of Life, Purpoſe, their Senſe of the Scope and Meaning of thoſe Things wherein they were Divinely Inſpired, and ſo to deliver it to After-ages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whatever they have ſpoken, or written, giving us more light and advantage to underſtand, and behold Scripture in its own Light, ought from them, or from any other, to be accepted with great regard; but if it do not thus, it cannot be accepted, even from the Writers of Scriptures themſelves upon a ſingle, or divided Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: They were ſo bounded by the very Things, and Words, they themſelves had once ſpoken and written by the Holy-Ghoſt, that all the deference to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Divine Things above others, was to be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in the cleareſt Expounding what themſelves and others had written by Divine Inſpiration, and to be diſcerned in the very Writings themſelves, and not to be drawn oracularly out of their Breaſts, when the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of Divine Inſpiration were not upon them: <hi>For he that is Spiritual, i. e.</hi> that God vouchſafes Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to, or pretends to it, muſt acknowledge all that is either truly written, or ſpoken by the ſame Inſpiration, to be <hi>the Commandments of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 37.</p>
                     <p>And as for the newneſs, freſhneſs, and life of Truth given by Divine Revelation, God graciouſly providing it ſhould remain, as Revelation left it, and the Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it hath done ſo, appearing with it; it is the ſame in all Ages; Divine never loſes of its life, nor abates of its vigor; what it was ſo many Ages ago, that it abides now; what the Holy-Ghoſt ſpoke ſo many Ages ago, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65165:207"/> it ſpeaks now as warmly as then: All Divine Truth given, is after the power of an endleſs life, the Eternal Increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Spirit lives in it, and gives Divine Quickneſs to it. It is yeſterday, to day, the ſame for ever; and ſo breathes its own ſenſe in Scripture, by the ordinary Aſſiſtances it vouchſafes to Holy, Humble, and diligent Waiters upon him in this, even as it did in the firſt Ages, though the extraordinary Motions are withdrawn.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſtill the Gifts and Endowments of thoſe Eminent Men, with all the Light, Truth, Grace, Learning and Reaſon, they ſhine to us with, ought to be eſteemed and improved?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes doubtleſs: For whatſoever Things are true, whatſoever things are pure, are of Virtue, and deſerved praiſe, they are Publick, and of God, wherever they are found: And whatever there is in theſe Elders, in their nearneſs to the Firſt Times, their Holineſs, their Sufferings, their great Learning, their Encounters of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, their Apologies for Chriſtianity, their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, their Contempt of this World, all is a Donation, and a Grace of God by them to his Church, and Mankind in general.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>And does not there ariſe great Evidence to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and the Doctrines and Practices of it, from ſuch eminent Witneſſes?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No doubt there does, both to Chriſtianity in particular, and to all Religion, Virtue and Goodneſs in general: But yet neither their Writings, nor Practices can in any wiſe become Scripture to us; they all lead to Scripture, and ought to do ſo; they are all to be ſeen, and reflected in Scripture Light, and from thence they receive their luſtre: For though they are a Subordinate Teſtimony, as hath been ſaid, yet Chriſtian Religion hath greater Teſtimony, and firſt enabled them to give a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Teſtimony to it ſelf, by Communicating ſo great knowledge and worth to them: And beſides all that hath
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65165:207"/> been ſpoken, the Writings of the Fathers are ſo Volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as not to be read over by the moſt; ſo doubtful in their Genuineſs, that they cannot be Examined, but with great Labour, and well prepared Judgment; ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable in their ſenſe, that to attain a certainty in it, would cut off Time from the greater Imployment of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation in the Word of God, day and night, where Men's Callings lie otherwiſe; ſo that to receive our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from hence were of too remote an aſſurance to any one, much more to thoſe who have not Books, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for their Profeſſion: But every Man, whether learned or unlearned, is concerned deeply to try his Religion with his own Eyes, and not anothers for him; and God hath therefore provided a Word nigh him, even in his Mouth, and in his Heart; and hath alſo taken care by ſtirring up ſo many both of the Ancient and Modern Chriſtians, to ſeparate themſelves to intermeddle with all ſacred knowledge, that there is a worthy exerciſe of the learned World herein, and great advantages ariſe thereby for univerſal knowledge even to the leſs learned, and the very unlearned.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But did the Fathers themſelves diſtinguiſh thus their own and one anothers Writings from Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is moſt evident, as hath been already affirmed, they put a greateſt difference betwixt the moſt excellent Monuments of Chriſtianity, that were but Humane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether their own, or others, and inſpired Pages; elſe <hi>Clement, Ignatius,</hi> and others, might as well have been Canoniz'd by them, as what is from them come down to us for Sacred Canon it ſelf; and even as they did, we may ſee the great odds betwixt the one and the other; and as we adore God the ſupreme Author, ſo the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Preſerver of Scripture, who by Divine Evidences, and by ſuperintending Providence, hath divided the bound of Scripture at ſo great a remove from all the Writings
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:65165:208"/> in the World, whether Chriſtian or Prophane, the Apocryphal Books not excepted, which though too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturouſly joyn'd ſo generally in a Volume with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet are evidently diſproportioned in the Majeſty of Senſe, and Divine Eloquence.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there no greater Authority of the Firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> How many Humanes ſoever meet, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make up Divine, where it was not before; nor can a multitude of Privates conſtitute a Publick: Divine and Publick may be declared, but cannot be made ſo by ſuch Contribution. All Determinations of Councils are infinitely outweighed in Value, and over-ruled in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by Scripture indeed Publick and Divine.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But in ſuch a number of his Servants, may we not conclude, God is certainly among them, and does guide them?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Give them all the advantages that can be given, and either we muſt ſay, they are Infallibly guided, and then we muſt receive their Decrees, as Scripture, and they muſt be atteſted to us, as Scripture is atteſted; or they are not Infallibly guided, and then their Decrees muſt be tryed, as all Fallibles ought to be, by a Rule ſurer than themſelves: If even Divine Revelation it ſelf was at firſt tryed, and found perfect; nay, if even all that God propoſes to us, as from himſelf, comes laden with its own proper Evidences, how much more muſt that which is confeſſedly humane, be tryed by that which is confeſſedly Divine? The great uſe of Councils is therefore ſo to debate, and bring things to a Reſult, by a confluence of Wiſdom and Learning, that we may ſee Divine Truths in their own Light, in Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to hold out which they are but miniſterially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, and not to impoſe upon any under the name of Publick; for that alone is Publick, that is Divine: All
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65165:208"/> Compariſon of Privates among themſelves, muſt needs be loſt in this Publick, before which the greateſt name of Publick, <hi>is but as the drop of the Bucket, and the ſmall duſt of the Ballance:</hi> And the union with that true Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick makes the moſt Private a Publick; and Separation from it, the moſt ſeemingly Publick, a moſt Idiottal Private.</p>
                     <p>And it were very happy, if the Experiment hereof were not too evident in the Councils that have been, how little Number of it ſelf can Contribute to truly Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, or Divine; yet the fitneſs of the Means is withall to be acknowledged, as ordain'd by God.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Church is <hi>The Catholick Congregation</hi> of Mankind, called to the Faith and Obedience of that Word it ſelf; and which being called it ſelf, is entruſted to call others to the ſame Faith, and Obedience, and ſo is Govern'd, and Governs according to it, by daily Exerciſes in, and according to that Word.</p>

Particular Churches, yea even Particular Perſons, truly of the Church, have every one the whole Character, Title, Promiſe, and Privilege of the Catholick Church, ſo far as they can need or receive them, even as Heaven is Entire Heaven to every ſingle Glorified Soul: Every Lively Member of the Church touches the Head and Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It was begun and hath always increaſed by Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons converted and brought home to God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Word, in ſeveral Ages and Succeſſions: For the Church, as it is a Church, is not a Society formed by a common Conſent of Men, or by their Will, but its ſeveral Parts are added by God, ſo that it conſiſts of all that are inwardly and truly of that Catholick Religion in God the Father, and in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by the Eternal Spirit, all the World over, and in which meet all that have been, are, or ſhall be thus converted by the Word of God, as the Church is, and ſhall be triumphant in Glory.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>The Call then that makes this Congregation, is firſt to God and Chriſt, and not to the Church it ſelf?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is evidently ſo: All true Converts firſt give themſelves to God and Chriſt, and, by vertue of That, to the Church. The Apoſtles were not ſollicitous of any other Conjoyning Men to the Church, than what moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily followed upon their receiving the Goſpel, and were afraid of their fixing upon them that were but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Servants: <hi>We preach Jeſus to be the Lord, and our ſelves Servants for Jeſus ſake.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians</hi> heading themſelves under <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> was very miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous; and therefore the Apoſtle knowing the Union ought to be only to Chriſt, directs himſelf ſo vehemently againſt it, as alſo againſt any fanciful Diſtinction of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Chriſt, as an ordinary Chief of a Party, and not as the Divine Head of the whole Body in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Truth: Even as he erred, that vulgarly called Chriſt <hi>Good,</hi> not knowing him to be God, the Supremely, Solely Good.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Are they all true Converts that are of the Church?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> All that are indeed the Church, are ſo; but all that may appertain to the Church, are not ſo: as <hi>all that were of Iſrael, were not Iſrael.</hi> There is a viſible Profeſſion, that is too often not ſincere; yet this makes Men <hi>Of,</hi> or <hi>belonging to</hi> the Church, but not truly <hi>The</hi> Church: <hi>Many are</hi> ſo <hi>called, that are not choſen.</hi> But all that are truly <hi>The Church,</hi> are alſo truly called, and truly Converts, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outwardly and viſibly the Church, but inwardly and inviſibly ſo too, <hi>whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God.</hi> In the mean time, they that are onely <hi>of</hi> the Viſible Church, have the Means of Grace, and are not thrown out of that Regiſter of God's People, till the Final Judgment cuts them off: A very great Benefit in it ſelf!</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is not the Church then ſo Catholick, or General, as the Profeſſion of the True Religion is?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Catholickneſs of the Church, as hath been often inculcated, is its Union to God and Chriſt, and that in ſincerity. As to the general Profeſſion, though the number of it be as the Sand of the Sea, <hi>a Remnant only ſhall be ſaved: For God will finiſh the Account, and cut it ſhort in Righteouſneſs; for a ſhort work will the Lord make in the Viſible Church:</hi> There ſhall be an often eating, or brouſing it off, a retrenching of it again and again; it ſhall caſt the Leaves of its meer Profeſſors, as the Teyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree or Oak, when yet their <hi>Subſtance is in them; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Seed are the Subſtance of it, Iſa.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> not loſing them, it loſes nothing.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle, in his Noble Deſcription of the Church, hath laid the Foundations of our Inſtruction here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in thoſe three Honourable Titles he hath given it:</p>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That it is <hi>the Houſe of the Living God.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. That it is <hi>the Pillar of Truth.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. That it is <hi>the Ground of Truth.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Before the Explanation of each of theſe Titles, in the firſt place, I deſire it may be determined, whether theſe things are ſpoken of the Catholick, or of a Particular Church, the Particular Church of <hi>Epheſus?</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although I have already affirmed, That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church differs from a Particular True Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Compaſs and Comprehenſiveneſs of it; yet I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry willingly repreſent it over again in this Inſtance: Theſe things are truly applied to the Catholick Church, to the Particular Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to every Particular Church; nay, it reaches down to every ſingle living Member of the Church, ſo far, that God makes his abode with him, dwells in him, he is a Pillar in the Houſe of God, the Truth reſts and dwells in him, and ſhall be with him for ever; ſo that he is a Ground of Truth, and hath more of the Church in him, than greater ſeeming Portions of it, that erre from the Truth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>If you pleaſe now to proceed in the Explanation of theſe Titles; and firſt, What is the Importance of the Churches being <hi>the Houſe of God,</hi> for the actuating the Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:65165:212"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> God, the moſt High Poſſeſſour and Owner of Heaven and Earth, places his Court, Family, and particular Reſidence where he pleaſes; and he hath choſen the Church to be this to him. <hi>This is my Reſt, here will I dwell for ever, for I have deſired it. Heaven is my Throne, Earth is my Footſtool; where is the Houſe you will build me? To this Man will I look, that trembles at my Word.</hi> And where God dwells, there he manifeſts himſelf: As a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Family makes known in his Houſe and Family his Nature, Will, Laws, and Government; ſo God does in his Church: <hi>In</hi> Judah <hi>is God known, his Name is great in</hi> Iſrael. In his Church he ſhews <hi>the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> expects and rewards Services, as a Great Maſter, and makes known his Diſlikes and Diſpleaſure. This is brought to paſs in the Church by thoſe many Ways that God hath of bringing his Word to any Places or Perſons, giving it Reception among them, and then ſtirring up his Children and Servants to hear his Voice, to ſearch his Mind and Will, and to underſtand it; ſo that it is as a Voice continually behind them. In his Temple there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in his Houſe, every one muſt needs ſpeak of his Glory: His Word cannot lie ſtill, for all are concerned to meditate, ponder, inquire, and diſcourſe of it, and are by Supreme Management excited ſo to do; and ſo much as this Exerciſe in his Word is by any means depreſſed, ſo far God is withdrawn, and the Excellency of the Church-ſtate loſt. Now of the Church being the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> there was this great Type: God dwelt in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as in a Palace; there was ſuch a Diet of Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread, changed every day; of Sacrifices of all ſorts; ſuch Perfumes of Incenſe and Odours, ſuch Officers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants attending continually, ſuch Reſorts of the whole Body of the People to the Court of this Great King and Princely Houſholder. Together with this State, runs along in a mighty Stream, <hi>Gods ſhewing his Word to Jacob,</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:65165:213"/> 
                        <hi>his Statutes and Judgments to Iſrael.</hi> In the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the Pomp and Ceremonial Part is wholly transferred into Spirituality; but Spirituality is not lower, but higher in the Subſtance of all that could be figured by theſe things: and the ſubſtantial part of that State, the Communication of the Word of God, is much exalted in the true Chriſtian Church, that the Light of One Day is now as much as the Light of Seven was before. Thus the Church, as the Family of God, cannot but actuate his Word.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the meaning of the Church being the <hi>Pillar of Truth?</hi> Does the Church ſupport Truth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Not ſo; for, <hi>it ſelf is built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-ſtone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How then is it ſaid to be the <hi>Pillar of Truth?</hi> And of what Importance is that to the Actuating Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> As the Laws and Ordinances of Courts and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments are publickly fixed, that every one may know and take notice of them; ſo the Church in all its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but eſpecially by Deputed Miniſters, giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to it, proclaims, preaches, and makes offer of the moſt Publick Notice of the Word of Truth, within it ſelf, that all the Children and Servants of the Family may be continually catechiz'd and built up therein, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers have opportunity to know, if they would apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it. Thus it is a Famous <hi>City ſet on an Hill, that cannot be hid;</hi> and therefore its Laws, Conſtitutions, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, cannot but in all reaſon be inquired of, by all that do ſo much as paſs by it: It is a <hi>Candleſtick,</hi> bearing the lofty Torch of Divine Truth. Of this the Pillars of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the affixing to them the Rolls of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, was an eminent Type, and alluded to by the Apoſtle. As therefore from a Prince come forth Edicts, Proclamations, Manifeſto's, and Declarations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65165:213"/> to Laws, which are faſtned to Publick Pillars of the Court it ſelf, and all open and conſpicuous Places of Concourſe; ſo are there in the Church the moſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Publications of the Divine Truth and Word, to all, both the Natives and Free-born of the Church it ſelf, and Ingenuous Strangers, that would hearken out the moſt Reaſonable Propoſals of Truth, or whom God is pleaſed to Naturalize to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the meaning of the Church being the <hi>Ground of Truth?</hi> And how does this actuate Scripture?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It means nothing but the Perpetuity and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Truth with the Church, eſtabliſhing it ſelf by all that Firmneſs of Divine Evidence and Reaſon, and on thoſe very Securities taking Poſſeſſion of the Church, as the Ark of its Strength, where it ſelf, or the God that is Truth it ſelf, places the Soles of his Feet, as on his unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Footſtool, for ever: Of which the Ark in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſt was a Type, the Footſtool of the Throne of Mercy, the ſecure Repoſitory of the Tables of the Covenant, the Ark of Teſtimony, over which the <hi>Shecinah</hi> or Glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared as inthron'd, attended with <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and ſetting its Feet upon it; <hi>the place of my Throne, and the place of the Soles of my Feet, Ezek.</hi> 43. 7. For thus the True Church, <hi>againſt which the Gates of Hell cannot prevail,</hi> is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Reſt of Truth: It adheres to Truth; it buys the Truth, and never ſells it; Truth dwells with it for ever: God never ſuffers it to apoſtatize from Truth; but by the conſtant holding of the Judgment, and retaining the Love and Zeal of the Affections of thoſe that are indeed his Church, he hath ſetled his Word in his Church on Earth, even as it is for ever ſettled in Heaven. The Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actuates Scripture, by finding out Reaſons, debating, enforcing, defending by all Arguments, that Truth of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo perſiſting in it for ever.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Cannot then the Church fail?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:65165:214"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It hath been ſaid before, the True Church cannot fail: For, the True Church is (as hath been deſcribed) the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth;</hi> and that which is ſo, cannot fail, and God will have ſuch a Church always in the World. If any Perſon, City, or Nation, that ſeem to have been the Church, have this Light eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>leſtick removes; for it is only a Candleſtick for the ſake of the Light: and the Pillar it ſelf ſhakes and falls, if the Records fixed to it are taken away: and the Palace and Court remove with the Prince, who is always with his Truth, and the lively Motion of it. So much Truth therefore, and active Diſplay of it, ſo much a Church, in any Place; and the Truth removing, or lying dead, the Church removes alſo, or is ready to die in that Place.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But is there no higher Senſe of the Church being the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth?</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No other, but what ariſes from the moſt intimate and inſeparable Union betwixt the Church and Truth; Truth taking an undefailable poſſeſſion of the Church: ſo that whereever Truth, in that Fulneſs as to lead to Life and Happineſs, is, there is the Church, and no where elſe. The True Church then may be ſtiled a <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi> in the higheſt Senſe, if rightly underſtood; that is, Truth it ſelf, that is the unmovable Pillar and everlaſting Foundation, hath ſo cloſely banded the Church with it ſelf, that it is One Pillar and Foundation with it. Thus the Church may be both the Building; and the Rock and Foundation, to ſucceeding Parts and Members of the Church: The Building, as it ſelf reſts upon the Pillar and Foundation of Truth; elſe it can't be the Church: The Pillar and Foundation of Truth, to the ſtill ſucceeding and riſing Church, as it is One with Truth it ſelf, to which every True Member firſt comes and unites, and therein to the Church; even as every Degree of Building is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and Support to the ſtill growing Building, not in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65165:214"/> it ſelf, but as it is ſurely cemented to the Foundation, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by it, and partakes its Strength: Yet if it ſwerve ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little from the Foundation, it is preſently a Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the more it ſwerves, the greater danger of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of it ſelf, and all that reſts upon it.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>May not this help to explain that ſo much diſputed Expreſſion of our Saviour,</hi> Thou art <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not preval againſt it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall be glad if it may give any Light to it, and hope it may: For the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> making that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Divinity of Chriſt, not ſingular, but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the whole Body of Apoſtles and Chriſtians, and being poſſeſſed with and by that Truth he confeſs'd, was both part of the Building upon that Rock, and, as united with that Rock, he became Rock it ſelf, upon which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeeding Chriſtians were to be built. The Prophets and Apoſtles are in this Senſe Foundations, and the Twelve Apoſtles Twelve Foundations, <hi>Chriſt himſelf being the Corner-ſtone, in whom alone the whole Building,</hi> even the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Foundation it ſelf, <hi>riſes,</hi> in a ſtrict and proper Senſe.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there not a good Security then in joyning our ſelves to the Church, to thoſe that have been in the Building before us?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No otherwiſe than as we joyn our ſelves, by their Miniſtry, to that Foundation it ſelf, which always lies ſure, upon which they themſelves muſt alone reſt, if the True Church. For, by placing our ſelves not upon them, but upon that Common Foundation, we are adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the whole Building that was before us, that lies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular with that Foundation, by the Care of him who is both the Foundation, Corner-ſtone, and is alſo he that built all things, even God in Chriſt</p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:65165:215"/>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>We muſt then ſeek to find the Truth by it ſelf, and then the Church by that Truth; and not the Church by it ſelf, and then the Truth by the Church?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very true: For God hath ſo in his Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom eſtabliſh'd the very Nature of Things. Truth can give many Aſſurances of it ſelf to us by it ſelf, ſo ſuited to our Faculties: The Church can give us none, but by its agreement with Truth, revealed in the Word of God. We could not have known ſuch a Congregation as the Church at all to be, much leſs which it is, but by that Word manifeſting it ſelf in our Conſciences, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing to us the True Church among the many Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociations in the World, each calling to us, as having the beſt Religion among themſelves. Even the True Apoſtles themſelves could be known to be ſo, and Falſe Apoſtles tried and found Liars, no other way, but by this Truth, view'd, and conſidered ſingly, and diſtinctly by it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But when we have found the Church by the Truth, may we not then deliver up our ſelves wholly to the Church, as ſo united to Truth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, by no means: We can never ſo deliver up our ſelves; nor will the True Church deſire any ſuch thing of us, ſeeing its Office is not to hold out it ſelf, but the Word of Truth; and in doing any thing elſe, it acts not as a Church, but as any other ordinary Society; and on no other Terms can we have to do with it: For the very Attempt to hold out, as a Church, any Laws of its own, ought to enter us into a Jealouſie whether it be the True Church, which is, as a Church, the Pillar and Reſt of Divine Truth only.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What Reaſon is there of ſuch a Jealouſie, when once we have found it a Church, by the Truth it holds out?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe a Church, that hath been a True Church, may ſeveral ways decline from its State.</p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:65165:215"/>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How then can it he ſaid,</hi> The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Prophetick Promiſe does not ſecure this or that Particular Church, but that there ſhall be a Seed of the Church in the World, with which the Covenant of God is Eternal: <hi>My Word ſhall not depart out of thy Mouth. nor out of the Mouth of thy Seed, or thy Seed's Seed, for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it is yet further true, the True Seed, the Holy Seed, the Subſtance of the Church, can never utterly and finally fail in any Particular Member of it; for if it could, it were too great a violation of our Saviour's Truth in that Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt his Church,</hi> or force that Immortal retrograde into Mortality, even that moſt dreadful one of the Second Death, for which a Succeſſion of others, and in the ſame Danger, is but a faint <hi>Salvo,</hi> though it go on ſo to the End of the World.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Who are this True Church in every Age and Place?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> They which are by True Saving Faith united to Chriſt the Son of God, the Rock of Eternity; and being ſo founded upon him, are Pillars that never remove, and a Reſt of Truth for ever, <hi>having been taught,</hi> and learnt it, <hi>as it is in Jeſus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Who are the Profeſſionary Church only?</hi>

They are ſuch as <hi>have not received the Truth in the Love</hi> and Obedience <hi>of it</hi> within themſelves, and ſo may fall away from it: It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of them, as of the former, <hi>The Truth ſhall be with them for ever,</hi> having made its <hi>Edr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Office of the Church being to Actuate Truth, and only Truth, it may fail, either in abating the Fervours due to Truth, though nothing Falſe or Forreign be admitted, or in receiving Falſhood, or things of a baſer Alloy, for Truth, and waſting thoſe Fervours due only to Truth upon them. The one may be called a departing from the true State of a Church; the other, from the State of a True Church: and they uſually meet one in another.</p>

Sometimes it forſakes Truth

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>In theſe Caſes how does it fare with the True Holy Seed, the Subſtantial Church?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How is it with them, when the very Place and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick are taken away?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is too often thrown up by Apoſtaſie or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneneſs, or dwindled into a very Spiritleſs Form; but very often a Profeſſion without the Power being not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the working of Iniquity, it may paſs out of this World like a Lamp burning: but being found to burn only in a ſmall Temporary Light, without Oyl in the Veſſel, a Plenitude of Grace in the Heart, ſhutting out every Luſt, it becomes a Lamp put out in utter Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there is no Truſt but in the Lord himſelf, the Truth it ſelf, by which at all times the Church, that is indeed the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> and wherein it is ſo, will be known to us; and in uniting to Truth, we are united to That.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>There remains one thing yet to be underſtood in the Deſcription of the Church, which is, its Power of Governing, even as it is Governed by the Word of God: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder what Notions, I beſeech you, is that Government expreſſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Power is by our Saviour repreſented under the Mataphor of <hi>Keys;</hi> and the Uſe of thoſe Keys, in <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhutting,</hi> or in <hi>Binding and Loſing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What is the meaning hereof?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning is plainly this; When the Church of Chriſt hath by the <hi>Key of Knowledge</hi> inquir'd into all the Divine and Heavenly Doctrine of the Goſpel and Word of God, it hath in and according to that Word, and only ſo, a Power of Application of that Doctrine to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſes, binding Men under the Senſe of Guilt, and fear of Damnation, in ſuch or ſuch Sins, and an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Continuance in them; or of Abſolving, and aſſuring Men of the Divine Favour and Acceptance, in a holy courſe
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:65165:217"/> of Life, and Obedience to God, and of Pardon upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, after Falls into Sin, and Diſobedience; and ſo of Declaring and Pronouncing upon Men, as to their preſent State in the Church, by Excommunication, or Abſolution; all theſe are the Power of <hi>Binding and Looſing;</hi> according to what our Saviour ſpeaks in parallel Words, <hi>Whoſe Sins you remit, they are remitted; whoſe Sins you retain, they are retained;</hi> meaning ſtill according to his Word, the Pole-Star by which they are to direct all their Motions, who claim any ſuch Power: For, only where it is declard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word, is it, that <hi>what is bound on Earth, is alſo bound in Heaven; and what is looſed on Earth, is looſed in Heaven;</hi> there being an Invariable Agreement between what is Publiſhed from Heaven, in the Word of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the State and Actions of Men on Earth, and the Tranſactions in Heaven, in relation to them. He then that pronounces agreeably with that word, pronounces as Heaven does and will pronounce; Heaven binds what he binds, and looſes what he looſes, becauſe he ſpeaks the Voice of Heaven in both Caſes.</p>
                     <p>But that there ſhould be any Binding or Looſing, except in the Power of this Word, and according to it, in its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in its Truth, nothing can be more contrary to the Ends, to the Glory, to the Soveraignty of Chriſt. To bind any ſingle Chriſtian by Excommunication, and not according to this Word, is as much a <hi>Brutum Fulmen,</hi> a Thunder to no purpoſe, <hi>a cauſeleſs Curſe, that ſhall not come,</hi> as for the <hi>Pope</hi> to Excommunicate whole <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is the Catholick Church in a Neighbourhood, or number of Chriſtians Communicating one with another ordinarily; even as the whole Cotholick Church, would, if it were poſſible, Communicate with it ſelf, in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Worſhip of Chriſt, exactly according the to Rules of his Word; wherein this is the diſtinguiſhing Character
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65165:218"/> of the True Church, that its <hi>Communion</hi> is not with it ſelf primarily, but its <hi>Communion</hi> is ſo with it ſelf, as to be with <hi>the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt</hi> principally, as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Head, Center and Rule of the <hi>Communion,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it holds out, and invites to its <hi>Communion.</hi>

All Wiſe and Prudent Aſſemblies have always had Elders to preſide over them; and our Lord hath ordained ſuch to moderate throughout his Congregation or Church, to conduct all the Publick Services of Religion: For all things therein are actually adminiſtred by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, the Nobleſt Organical Parts of the Church, like thoſe Senſes that attend upon the Underſtanding moſt immediately; Seeing Eyes, and Hearing Ears; ſo theſe upon the Word of Chriſt.

From the Eſtimation and Honour due to the Diſcharge of their Work, and the Authority it ought to carry in the Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Chriſtians, they are ſtyled <hi>Biſhops, Elders, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Guides, and Enſamples,</hi> as alſo, <hi>Embaſſadours:</hi> And the Work and the Honour do ſo encloſe one another, that they ought not to be ſeparated, and are in their Inſtitution the Meaſure one of another, extending both to Obedience, and Support of them in their Work; and the Titles are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt, that they ought not to be changed for any other, nor the Scripture Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage herein to be altered, for any Words not importing the ſame proper Senſe.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſt as the Head of the Church, <hi>hath aſcended up on high, and given gifts to Men, and as the Lord of the Harveſt</hi> takes it upon him, as his Supreme Care, to <hi>thruſt forth Labourers into his Harveſt.</hi> The ſeveral Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſtians, obſerving Miniſterial Abilities, and Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Teach, call out to ſuch to help them; and herein, in the Ceſſation of Extraordinary Gifts, the Schools of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Religious Education, like the Schools of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Generally and ordinarily he does ſo; the Officers are therefore more particularly entruſted by Chriſt with the Keys, even as the Church in general is. Thus emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, our Lord found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Church, and ſo edifies and builds it up in After-ages, by Paſtors and Teachers; and when great Defections have prevailed upon it, ſummons it to Reformation, by ſome rais'd up among thoſe Officers, and whom he ſends out, as ſuch, to reform and recover his Church: Yet ſtill all this Power is in and according to his Word, and no other; and ſo, that in all things, as much as may be, the Knowledge, Judgment and Approbation of the Church is to be joyn'd in all the Officers do, as having their Intereſt in the Keys alſo; becauſe they have their Intereſt in the Word of God, in the Underſtanding, Opening and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of which to Particular Caſes, the whole Power of the Keys reſts. The Apoſtles, Elders, and the Brethren, or whole Church, were together pleaſed, and together joyn'd in that Famous Conciliary Epiſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 22.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will very willingly do as you deſire, and begin with the Apoſtles.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It ſtood in their Preaching, Acting, Directing, Governing, by that Immediate and Infallible Aſſiſtance of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65165:219"/> the Divine Spirit, by which they writ and ſealed Scripture, and by which they were ſo guarded every way, that they could turn neither to the Right Hand nor to the left, in any thing wherein they exerciſed this Power.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How was this Power Juſtified?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the Divineneſs, ſubſtantial Goodneſs, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of all their Preſcriptions, propos'd in all the Methods of Rational Diſcourſe, and manifeſtation of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Mens Conſciences, witneſs'd to by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and authoriſed by a Power of Miracles, generally of Beneficence, or doing good; and in ſome, but ſparing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of infliction of Bodily Pains, or Death.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Did the Apoſtles never err in their Adminiſtration?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whenever that Infallible Guidance was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them, they might err, as was before obſerved in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Miſcarriage, which no doubt was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to ſhew their Power was not in themſelves, but in the Divine Spirit acting by them; that none in After-ages, might pretend to dictate as their Succeſſors, having not their Power, and yet requiring Obedience, as if they had it; whereas even the Apoſtles themſelves might err, and ſo loſe their Power, if never ſo little deſerted by the Holy Spirit: And therefore what they conſigned over to After-ages, was winnowed from every thing Humane and Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that both Officers and People might know the one Common Rule, by which one is to Govern, the other, in the Application of it, is to be Governed.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Who were next to the Apoſtles in this Office and Power?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw. Evangeliſts,</hi> ſuch as were <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who having a Portion of the Apoſtolick Work, to plant and ſettle Churches, and Ordinary Officers in them, had alſo a Portion of their Power to enable them to it, it being abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary there ſhould be ſuch, till the General Rule was fully ſettled and fixed.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Were not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts above Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſtors and Teachers?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:65165:220"/>
                     <p> 
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> They were, in this great Point of Difference, that they had the Word of God by Immediate and Infallible Revelation committed to them, to commit the ſame to others, by direction from the ſame Spirit, who gave them Diſcerning to whom to entruſt it, till all things relating to the Kingdom of God in the Church were ſealed in the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> elſe they owned themſelves <hi>Compresbyters,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſtiles himſelf, <hi>A Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter with Presbyters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>From all that hath been ſpoken, we are to conclude, That the whole Power in the Church, and in all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Religion, is retained in the Word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is ſo: For Chriſt in his Word is the only King and Lawgiver of his Church, which <hi>Glory he will not give to another:</hi> Whatever Power can be ſuppoſed reſident in the whole Church together, is no other than in that Word of Truth publickly offered by it. The Apoſtles Power was only the preſence of that Word to them, by the Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelation, and infallible Guidance of the Holy Spirit, for the Preaching it throughout the World, and thereby founding the Chriſtian Church: Such was the ordinary Power of any extraordinary Miniſters under them. The and conſtant Rulerſhip of the Elders of the Church remains unmoveably in the Word, which it is their Office to ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Are not thoſe we diſtinguiſhingly call <hi>Biſhops,</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours to the Apoſtles, in that Preeminency they had over other Paſtors and Elders?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Succeſſors to the preeminency of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles may be well eſtabliſhed, Three things are neceſſary,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That there be found, and produced Diſtinct Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands given in Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65165:220"/> We muſt find the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhing, ordinary Presbyters; as <hi>Inferior Miniſters,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Superior Miniſters;</hi> and thoſe Superior Miniſters, <hi>as Superiors;</hi> as we find him diſtinguiſhing Civil Magiſtrates into <hi>the King, as Supreme; and Governors, as thoſe that are ſent by him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. Seeing it is very clear, and apparent, there is nothing more diſtant from the Deſign of the Goſpel, than to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute any thing for the ſake of making a great Figure, without as great an Uſe, or End; and that Chriſt hath not given Power to his Rulers to Command the very leaſt thing, but as Commanded by himſelf firſt, for then they would be <hi>Lords,</hi> which he plainly declares againſt, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely denies to them, and that what they do as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him, they ſhould do ſo in Duty and Service to the Supreme Lord, and Subordinately to his Church, as not to be called, or eſteem'd <hi>Benefactors</hi> for their Services; ſo that it muſt be evident, what their Superior Service is; it muſt be plainly expreſſed in the Word of God, and there at leaſt ſo determinately ſet down, as to be deduced with greateſt clearneſs to the Underſtanding and Conſcience of Chriſtians, and diſtinguiſhingly from the Service of other Subordinate Rulers appointed by Chriſt, that ſo it may be waited for, and received according to his Ordinance with Faith and Obedience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Seeing Chriſt appoints none to an Eminency of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, without a ſuitable Eminency of Abilities, as is plain in the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> it is therefore reaſonable to expect ſome extraordinary promiſes of the preſence of Chriſt to thoſe Superior Miniſters, to aſſiſt them in the Conduct of their Superiority, wherein they might, above any other Miniſters of the Goſpel, Viſibly and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally make ſome approaches to the Eminent Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> had in the time of their Miniſtry, and that they have continued, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in their High Function in the Church of Chriſt,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65165:221"/> ſo, that the Hiſtory of the Real, Subſtantial Services of Biſhops to Chriſtianity, hath come near to the Acts of Apoſtles, and as much excelled that of Common Presbyters, as the Order it ſelf is ſuppoſed to do: Now without theſe three ſelf evident concurrent marks of Superiority, ſecret inviſible Characters are of no ſignification.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How then is ſuch a Succeſſion of Biſhops, in a Superiority over Presbyters, ſo uncontrolably deduced from Antiquity?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides all other Coincident Accounts, there is this to be given. After the Apoſtles, there was but a Gradual Ceſſation of Apoſtolick Men, Men of Eminent Graces and Extraordinary Gifts, though not of the Infallible Guidance of the Divine Spirit for the Revelation of the Goſpel, or the writing of Scripture; yet of more immediate Divine Aſſiſtances, in reſemblance of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> for the Confirmation of the Churches planted by the Apoſtles, Superviſal over them, and Care for them; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the further propagation of Chriſtianity, which being but newly ſet out, had not arrived many places, where it was to come, and ſo needed ſome more than ordinary Aſſiſtances: Even as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles did not immediately Ceaſe, no more did theſe Perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges extraordinary in their Endowments: Such as theſe were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily in a Degree of Superiority over thoſe that had not the ſame miraculous Inablements, nor Knowledge as yet in Chriſtianity. Afterwards ſuch Manifeſtations of the Divine Preſence by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees retiring, and Chriſtianity having fixed it ſelf where it was then to go, and the Churches ſettled, the beſt accounts of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing Diſtinction between thoſe that were upon the ſame level, in regard of their Gifts and Graces were but Humane Prudence and Order, which oblige no Man's Conſcience beyond the valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Reaſons of that Prudence and Order. Except un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Holineſs, Induſtry, and Improv'd Underſtanding recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend any Perſon to ſuch Eminency. For Eminency, and being Taller than others in thoſe Qualifications, will make any Perſon a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> in the true ſenſe of one, whether ſo ordinated or not; and cannot make him that is a Dwarf in theſe, truly a Biſhop; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for Orders ſake he may ſtand in the place of that Figure.</p>
                     <p>He that excels in his Knowledge of, Obedience to, Zeal for, and Authority in the Word of God, ſeeing that Word conveys all this kind of Power from it ſelf, muſt needs have more of that kind of Power ſo conveyed than others; for the more purely this Word is underſtood and Preached, the more Power goes out of it, and along with thoſe that diſplay it, and ſo they become Paſtors of a higher Character, whether of a higher Order, or not.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw</hi> No: There were ſuch evident Marks of Divine Doctrine always given by God, to thoſe that deſired to Know, Love, and Obey him, that even the very Prophets and Apoſtles were not to be received without them, nor to be believed but according to them, nay, to be plainly Anathematiz'd, if they varied from it: Chriſtians were therefore to judge, to try the Spirits, to ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whether the things ſpoken were ſo; to have recourſe to undoubted Principles of Truth, that were as ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards to all that came after, beſides the Unction from the Holy One, whereby they were inabled to know all things neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But is not all Humane Teaching, and Inſtruction, hereby taken away, and what becomes of the Miniſtry, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip of the Church, and their Rule?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> They are all hereby Eſtabliſhed; for they are the Ordination of God to this very purpoſe, to make Men ſee, to bring them Light, to clear things to them, that by the awakening their Judgments, the ſummoning and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Principles, they may ſee with their own Eyes the ways of God and Religion; the Holy Spirit graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly adjoyning it ſelf to their Miniſtry: They have no Dominion over their Faith, but are helpers of thier Joy; that is, they facilitate, and make pleaſant the knowledge and aſſurances of Religion; and they Rule, by Exhorting, Admoniſhing, Rebuking, Comforting, and even Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in the Evidences of Divine Authority, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which they are to be obey'd, and highly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Works ſake.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all this, no Man is excluded from his own Office to himſelf; for every particular Chriſtian is in ſome Senſe a Congregation, and Preacher to himſelf, as <hi>Solomon;</hi> his Conſcience hath the Keys, binds, and looſes

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>FRom the precedent Diſcourſe of the Church, I conceive, the trueſt Notion of Schiſm may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced: I deſire you therefore to Explain what the true Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Schiſm is?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Queſtion concerning the Nature of Schiſm, follows very pertinently upon the right ſettlement of the Nature of the Church; now the whole Being of the Church conſiſting in its Union to God and Chriſt in Love, according to the Truth of his Word, and that it receives all its Members into Union with it ſelf, by their being firſt united, as it ſelf is. Schiſm, which is Diviſion, muſt needs, in its ſtricteſt and moſt formal Notion, be a
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65165:224"/> Diviſion from that Truth, wherein the whole Church is one, and ſo from the Love conſequent upon ſuch an Union.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What is that Truth of the Word of God, in which the Church is One?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Truth of the Doctrine of God, or the Unity of the Faith of the Son of God in things to be believed; and the Truth of his Law and Commands in things to be done.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How is the Love of the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited in theſe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is a Love in the Truth; and hereby we know we Love the Brethren, when we Love God, and keep his Commandments, <hi>John Epiſt.</hi> 2. No Love, how great ſoever, is Chriſtian-love; nor Union, how cloſe ſoever, Chriſtian-union, if it be not in the Truth, and Commandments of God: From whence it neceſſarily follows, the Schiſm, that is a Schiſm from the Church, muſt be a Diſunion from the Faith of the Scriptures, and the Love ſpringing from that Faith; and there is no danger of any other Schiſm from the Church, as it is a Church.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How does Schiſm differ from Hereſie?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Hereſie in the higheſt Senſe, and worſt Senſe of it, is a Diſunion from Truth in ſome Fundamental and Grand Concernment of Religion, either in the Doctrine, or Commands of God, ſo that a Man is ſubverted, and ſinneth, and muſt needs be Condemned of a Separation from the Aſſembly of Truth, both by himſelf, and the Thing it ſelf; and that both as to Faith, and Chriſtian-love, he is ſo ſeparated. Schiſm is a Diſunion in ſome leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous parts of this Truth, under an apprehenſion of a greater moment, than there is indeed in the Cauſes of ſuch a Diſunion, and a proportionable abatement of Chriſtian Love ariſing from it.</p>
                     <p>All Hereſie therefore includes Schiſm, but all Schiſm does not riſe up to Hereſie.</p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:65165:224"/>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Are theſe the Scripture Notions of Schiſm, and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, according to its uſe of thoſe Words?</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> By no means; if it be a Modeſt and Humble Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt and Suſpenſion concerning the Truth, and Command of God, in ſome things of ſmaller moment, and doubtful; yea though it comes to a poſitive Determination, ſo far as a Man's judgment, and yet erroneous, can at the preſent diſcern, it cannot be branded as Schiſm, if there be no ſtreſs laid upon the Thing beyond its deſert, if the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the greateſt and cleareſt Truths and Commands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains firm, and the Love due to ſuch an Union with the Church of God, be ſincere and fervent; yea even Diſſent in greater points thus qualified, and free from ill practice, hath not been rigidly cenſur'd for Hereſie.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there no danger then of running into Schiſm, if there be an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Truth?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this Senſe only; when the weakneſs or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion of others are rated againſt them beyond their Merit, and without regard to the greater Truths they agree in, and the Love due to them, upon Union in thoſe greater Truths is withdrawn, or the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in endeavouring to reſtore the Erring Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. This may be juſtly eſteem'd like Schiſm, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes from the juſt value of Great Truths, and from the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:65165:225"/> Charity of Chriſtians upon Union in them; but no Man is to eſpouſe any Mans Errors, or to receive even Truth by an implicit Faith, for fear of Schiſm; in things that carry not a broad Evidence of Divine Truth, there is great ſcope for Modeſt Suſpenſions, and even Diſſents, without Imputation of Schiſm; for Truths of magnitude either in Doctrine, Worſhip, Practice, or Diſcipline, are too bright to be refuſed by ſincere and honeſt Minds, after due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Wherein lies then the great Evil of Schiſm?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Schiſm, and the Evil of it, may better be underſtood, I will ſet before you the ſeveral Inſtances of Schiſm in Scripture, and the Evils noted by the Apoſtle in each of them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The firſt ſort of Schiſm, is the Diſunion in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Doctrine of the Goſpel, and bringing in upon it the neceſſity of the Judaique Rites to concur with it: This the Apoſtle to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 16. 17. calls making Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Parties, beſide, or contrary to the Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: The great Evil of this adding to the Word of God, is, that it lays Scandals before Men, and draws them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this great miſchief, that inſtead of the pure nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Divine Truth, all runs into this over-beloved Sentiment, and ſo deprives the Soul of the true and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Spirits of Truth; and alſo the Service due to True Chriſtianity is drain'd away, and conſumed upon this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Opinion, which is indeed the miſchief of all Falſhood in Religion, and Devotion in Things not appointed by God, who only can preſcribe what is truly fitted to our Good, and bleſs it with ſuitable Effect: Miſcarriage from Divine Truth is always found in Schiſm, with this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Conſequence, that it deceives the Soul with a Cloud and Wind, inſtead of Truth and ſolid Good.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A Second kind of Schiſm the Apoſtle Notes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 19, 20. was the Diſorder in Divine-Worſhip, in that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:65165:225"/> great Ordinance of the Lords Supper, wherein they that were reprov'd were neceſſitated to withdraw, and to ſtand apart for the manifeſting themſelves in the purity of that Worſhip and Service, for the very honor of it. The great Evil of this Schiſm is, that it brings in a neceſſity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided Parties in Publick Religion, and the Duties of it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Men muſt ſeparate from ſuch Corruptions, and ſtand at a Diſtance from them, on Account of which Religion it ſelf is diſhonoured, as if it were a Jumble of Sects, and gave an uncertain ſound; and further than that, is charged, as if it were but a Sect it ſelf, becauſe it ſtands by it ſelf: Thus Chriſtianity was called, <hi>This Sect,</hi> and the <hi>Sect of the</hi> Nazarenes: Idolatry damns the True Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, as a Hereſie from it ſelf, and the Falſe Church charges the truly Publick-Aſſembly with Schiſm, and a Private Religion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Another Degree of Schiſm the Apoſtle taxes in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>c.</hi> 4. 3. was, that this one intire Profeſſion of Chriſtianity in the one Univerſal Church of Chriſt, they thought, ought to be ſhred into little Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities, under the Names of ſome prime Miniſter of Chriſtianity, or even under the Name of Chriſt himſelf, as an ordinary Maſter of a Party, except we will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that, Thoſe Approved, who ſtood firm in Chriſt alone, were manifeſted, and ſtood alone, by being at a diſtance from the Schiſm of others, and ſo appeared, as was ſaid before, like a Schiſm themſelves. Thus vain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy parcell'd out it ſelf under its great Maſters. The great Evil of this, is, that it raiſes Feuds, Contentions, and Factions, as if this one Integral Chriſtianity could have diſtinct Intereſts, and ſome ingroſs one Intereſt, others ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Whereas the Apoſtle thus reduces this Schiſm; all Miniſters, ſaith he, with all their Gifts, Graces, and Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are the whole Churches, without any cantoning, other than, that Order and Conveniency requires the more

                     <p n="4">4. The laſt Inſtance of Schiſm (I find in Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is intimated to us, under that curious Parable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. of the Wiſe and Excellent Temperament betwixt the ſeveral Members of the ſame Body, ſet in different Degrees of Dignity; <hi>the leſs comely parts have more abundant Comlineſs, and thoſe that we think to be leſs Honourable, on theſe we beſtow more abundant Honour, that there ſhould be no Schiſm in the Body, but that the Members ſhould have the ſame care one for another;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Elegant Shade the Apoſtle teaches, that a neglect, and a contemptuous over-looking the Rights and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the lower and leſs Honourable Members in the Church, incurs the guilt of Schiſm, as arguing the want of that Compaſſion, and Feellingneſs, that ſprings from the head of the Church, down through the higher, to the meaneſt of his Members; <hi>for no Man ever hated his own Fleſh,</hi> even the meaneſt, and loweſt part of it, <hi>but nouriſhes, and cheriſhes it, even as the Lord the Church.</hi> They therefore, that carry the greateſt Grace, and Honour in the Church, ſhould inveſt the leaſt come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Members with more abundant Honour and Comlineſs, in the moſt humble Chriſtian Condeſcenſions, and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Treatment, covering all their defects, in Imitation of

To be perfectly united therefore in the ſame Judgment and Mind, and to ſpeak the ſame thing God hath ſpoken in his Word, and herein to Love one another; to obſerve the ſame pattern of Worſhip given by God himſelf; to look upon our ſelves, as only Chriſts, and all Miniſters to be the whole Churches, given it by Chriſt alike, ſo far as God gives us opportunity to enjoy them; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Honour of the higheſt Members, and to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more abundantly the meaneſt, as being all the Body of Chriſt, and ſo tempered by him; and wherein we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in this State of the Church come up to the exactneſs of theſe things, yet to perform thus in the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of each of them, and in the ſmaller to tollerate, and forgive one another, theſe are our ſecurity, and certain preſervation from Schiſm.</p>

                     <p>Wherein then Conſcience is miſtaken, and misjudges either way, againſt that which is Commanded by God, or for that which is forbidden by him, there is nothing to be done, but to reduce Conſcience to its Right Rules, which is the Will of God in every thing, revealed in his

But in things neither Commanded, nor Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, if Conſcience be apprehenſive of danger any way, this is the Honour and Dignity that God hath conferred upon Conſcience, as his immediate Vicegerent in the Soul, and carrying his Authority, (by always preſenting it in his Word, and Command,) that a Man ſhould ſuſpend his Action, wherein Conſcience is not ſatisfied, and at reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Goodneſs of the Action; and this is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which thoſe that are above, either in their Authority in the Church, or the ſtrength of their Underſtanding, Gifts, or Graces, ſhould beſtow upon thoſe that are below, that they ſhould not either by their Authority, Influence, or Example, Scandaliſe the little ones, or the weak, that are ſo, either in regard of their low Station, or the weakneſs of their Gifts, and Graces, that is, draw them into the Sin of doing any thing, of which Conſcience hath a miſtruſt of diſpleaſing God in ſo doing, in regard, that it both weakens, and diſables Conſcience in the diſcharge of that Truſt repoſed in it, for the carrying on the Soul in a Chriſtian Courſe, its Authority being violated, and proſtrated in the reverence due to it, and diſturbs the Peace and Comfort it ought to Miniſter to the Soul in that Courſe: For by this ſort of Scandal, the Apoſtle Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the Weak Chriſtian falls into Sin, his Conſcience is defiled, is wounded, is grieved, is made weak: All the miſchief of which, the value of indifferent things is not ſuch, as that it can anſwer, and make recompenſe for; and ſo to ſin thus againſt the weak, is to deſtroy them for whom Chriſt died, and therefore to ſin againſt Chriſt; which is the reaſon of thoſe weighty Diſcourſes of our Saviour againſt Scandal, <hi>Mark</hi> 18. and of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and 1 <hi>Cor. c.</hi> 8. and <hi>cap.</hi> 10. which being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, give great light one to another.</p>

                     <p>But how little Uniformity is to Chriſt or his Kingdom, in thoſe things wherein he hath not interpoſed at all, but left Chriſtians free, and intended they ſhould be free, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I will do it very briefly, as being too large for the preſent purpoſe to enumerate many, or enlarge upon any of them: But what more proper to delineate ſuch a State, than the Apoſtaſie the Apoſtle deſcribes, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 3. and 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1. 4. or than the Church in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 14. the Witneſſes Prophecying in Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, being ſlain, and lying dead three Days and a half, True Chriſtianity being in all appearance extinct: The meaſuring the Altar, the Temple, and thoſe that Worſhip in it, ſignifying the cloſe Retirement of Pure Religion, and the outward Court left to be trodden down by the Gentiles, or Heathen Chriſtians, and their impure Rites, and Worſhip; and therefore excluded from thoſe ſtrict meaſures true undefiled Chriſtianity is enclos'd within, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Now upon all theſe Repreſentations of ſuch a State of the Church, ſo exquiſitely ſhadowed and reſembled, and compared with that deep plunge and immerſement of Chriſtian Religion in the time of the Popiſh Midnight,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65165:234"/> who can but believe, theſe, with many concurrent Delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in all thoſe forecited Scriptures, were on purpoſe to give the Portraicture of that ſo Fatal Apoſtaſie, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it at all to be Propheſied in the Book of God? and who, that conſiders the weight of the thing, can but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it foretold, if there be any thing prophetick of the State of Chriſtianity to the end of the World? As it moſt evidently appears there is.</p>
                     <p>But if any be ſo incredulous, as to ſuppoſe ſuch a State of Chriſtianity beneath the Prefigurations of the Divine Spirit, he cannot, if he be indeed a Proteſtant, but agree, that nothing does with more Art and Divine Skill Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, and Draw to the Life ſuch a Devaſtation of Chriſts True Religion, as all Hiſtory knows Popery hath made, and as far as it can prevail, does now, and would do much farther, and in its very Frame is conſtituted ſo to do.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But ſeeing you ſuppoſe theſe Types of Popery may be applyed another way, though it is, I confeſs, very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſuppoſed; yet I deſire, if any thing hath fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Obſervation, that can be leſs avoided, to make plain, how different a Religion Popiſh-Chriſtianity is from the Scripture-Chriſtianity, you would give me leave to ask what it is?</hi>

                     <p>That then, which was accounted for in the beginning, being remembred, I ſhall eſpecially apply my ſelf to aſcertain True-Chriſtianity in contradiction to the falſe, or Popiſh Chriſtianity, by that which will much aſcertain all True Religion alſo in General, and difference it from all Falſe Religion.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But you ſeem to have forgotten the City, and all the Parts of it lying Fourſquare, and being ſolid ſquare mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, for ſo it muſt be, if the Length, Bredth, and Height are all equal?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I did not at all forget it, but ſuffered your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to lead through all, I leſs deſign'd, that they might come to the Principal Character of the True Religion and the True Church, ſo exactly adequate to one another.</p>
                     <p>Queſt <hi>Will you then more fully explain this Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I may the better do it, I muſt repeat it from the very Ground and Bottom of it, which is, that God makes uſe, as he pleaſes, of all the Knowledge and Science that is in the World, to Miniſter to Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in which he principally intends to Inſtruct, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt abſolutely neceſſary for all, of what condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: As then Mathematicks is the moſt Demonſtrative Science, and ſome things in it are of moſt retired and fine Speculation, ſo are others moſt known, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all imployed in Mechanicks: Thus God hath been pleaſed to depoſite ſome Prophetick Truths in the moſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65165:236"/> myſtick parts of that Learning, and ſome of the more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe in the moſt known and acquainted parts of it; now thoſe that are more ſecret, and not ſo neceſſary, I ſhall leave to thoſe that are moſt fitted thereunto: But what is moſt plain, and imports what is moſt neceſſary for all, I will inſiſt upon.</p>
                     <p>As then Number and Meaſure are means Ordained for Humane Nature, and principal Inſtruments of Reaſon, to come to the moſt certain knowledge of things, and to be ſecured, they are, and continue what they juſtly ought to be; ſo True Religion is thereupon preſented to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der exact Number and Meaſure, falling in one with another, the Number Twelve multiplied into a Square Cube of Twelve thouſand Furlongs.</p>
                     <p>And as the Fourſquare Figure does ſo bind, and is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with it ſelf, that it cannot receive the leaſt Addition, but with the loſs of its Square, nor the leaſt Diminution, but under the ſame Forfeiture; thus True Religion is ſo perfectly it ſelf, that it can neither be added to, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed from, but with a proportionable loſs of it ſelf: God was pleaſed upon this account to chuſe this Figure for the Altar under the Law, for the Breaſt-Plate of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this was the Meaſure of <hi>Solomons</hi> Oracle, how far the Meaſures in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> agree, I leave. The Heathen by Natural Wiſdom had ſuch a Senſe of the ſo Juſt to it ſelf, <hi>Fourſquare,</hi> that they called a Good Man, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or a Fourſquare Man.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, as Solid Square Meaſure is in all parts of it, and throughout every part, exactly Square, and gives the moſt certain account of the whole content of a Body; ſo is True Religion in all its Parts exactly ſo it ſelf, and every Part of every Part is reduced to the ſame exactneſs; for ſo the Length, Bredth and Height of it are equal; and ſo is the True Church exactly adequated to True Religion: The Faith is therefore ſaid to be at once delivered to the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65165:236"/> Saints, becauſe it can receive no New Meaſures, and it is called, the Common Salvation, or Doctrine of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Univerſal Standard is one.</p>
                     <p>This then is the <hi>Meaſure of a Man</hi> and the <hi>Meaſure of the Angel:</hi> For by that Wiſdom, that is natural to a Man, in which Beaſts have no ſhare, that is, to Number and Meaſure, is made plain to us Angelical Number and Meaſure, that is, the Number and Meaſure of True Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Angel delineated it, beginning in the Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Twelve, and Multiplied by it ſelf to an exact Square Figure or Meaſure; Square in the whole product, Square in every particular part, and of that juſt content. And with this exact Number Twelve, ſo Fourſquare, agreed the Altar, Temple, and they that worſhipped therein; when the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court was left out of Meaſure, to be trodden under Foot by Heatheniſh Idolatry, and Superſtition, diſguis'd under Popiſh Chriſtianity; of which whenever it ſhall be perfectly freed, it ſhall appear in that Glory here deſcrib'd. All richeſt Pearl, pure Gold, moſt tranſparent Jaſper, that is Brighteſt, Cleareſt Truth, and of the exact Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Number and Meaſure.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Is there no farther Improvement to be made of this Divine Symbole, the Fourſquare City?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is, when I have firſt obſerved to you Falſe-Religion is out of all Square, juſt Meaſure, and even Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; it is a conſtant and perpetual <hi>Odd,</hi> wandring from True Religion, and the juſtneſs of it to it ſelf; and that both in Doctrine, Worſhip, Rules of Life and Diſcipline, ſo that it is impoſſible in it to Meaſure one thing from and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or any one point of any of theſe by it ſelf, uneven in the whole Product, uneven in every part; uneven in the Root: The moſt ſignificant Emblem of the Popiſh-Church, which having the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, hath yet loſt the Apoſtolical Twelve, by innumerable moſt irregular, and wild Additions, and deformed every Single Article of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65165:237"/> Truth by moſt diſagreeable Corruptions of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as a Man moſt Learned in Numbers hath demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, the Number 666, a Number no way to be reduced to a Fourſquare Figure, is the moſt Fit, and Significant Hieroglyphick of it, and indeed, of all Falſe-Religion, that muſt have ſomething of Truth, to make it a Religion; but as it is falſe, is an <hi>Odd</hi> from that Truth.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Let me now deſire the moſt plain and uſeful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this Parabolick Scheme?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> You ſhall have it; and it conſiſts in obſerving Four Prime Characters of the True Chriſtian Religion, that may be as Four Equal ſides of this Fourſquare, and of the Church adjuſted to it; from each of which may be meaſured to each of the reſt, and the Equality, or Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, will diſcover the Truth or Falſhood of all that is brought to the Tryal.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Tranſcendant Holineſs, Goodneſs, and Purity of the Doctrine, Precepts of Worſhip, Rules of Life, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, is one ſide of this Chriſtian-ſquare, with which whatever does not Square, is convicted not to be of that Doctrine and Religion; whether it look towards God, in all the Higheſt, moſt Honourable Apprehenſions of him, ſuitable Diſcourſe, Worſhip, Love and Obedience; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it look towards Men, in all Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Mercy, Compaſſion, Charity, Benevolence, Beneficence; and theſe, as they reſpect all the particular Offices of Life; Publick, of Magiſtrates, Subjects; or Private, as of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, Children; Husband, Wife; Maſter or Servants: The Peace and Welfare of Mankind are treaſur'd up in the Law of Chriſt; or laſtly, whether it look to a Mans own Perſon, in Soberneſs, Purity, Continency in the Thoughts, the Words, the Actions. The Honour and beſt State of the Mind and Body are provided for by this Doctrine that is after Godlineſs, not only in the World to come, but in this Life: Whatever now does not agree
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65165:237"/> with theſe wholeſom words, is detected not to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; which is all Truth, Virtue, and Praiſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. There being nothing more intimate to Man, in this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſtate, than the Senſe of Guilt, and knowledg that he is a Sinner, the whole platform of Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt is become like the Original Law of Righteouſneſs, by which Man was formed, and Anſwers to it in all the Attributes of Perfection; as therefore the Plot of Reſtoration by the Son of God infolds it within it ſelf, and anſwers every way exactly to it, ſo that very Law and Doctrine of Holineſs owns the Reconciliation and Attonement by that great Sacrifice, as Equilateral to it ſelf, the Dimenſions of one being found correſpondent in the other, and each to be Tryed one by the other; ſo great a Sacrifice would be unneceſſary, if it had not ſo great a Law to anſwer; ſo great a Law can be anſwered by ſo great a Sacrifice, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by that: It muſt have that; it can need, it can acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no other. So then, the one may be Meaſured by the other: The Holineſs, Purity of ſuch a Law violated, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſuch an Effectual Pacification, and Purgation of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſuch a Renovation as Chriſtianity ſets before us. Such a Sacrifice, ſuch a Renovation or Sanctification by the Divine Spirit from it, teaches us, what an excellent Law was violated; ſo often therefore is the <hi>Lamb</hi> made the Title of our Lord and Savour, ſo o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ten it is Signally Recorded in the <hi>Revelation;</hi> and the Names of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles <hi>of the Lamb</hi> are ſaid to be written in the Foundations of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſhew the weight of the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Sacrifice in the Blood of Chriſt, and the Holy Spirit breathing in and from it, in Renovation and Sanctification.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Liberty that Jeſus Chriſt hath brought in by his Goſpel, is another Equilateral Character of his True Religion, to be Meaſured by each of the former, and it alſo Meaſures them: It is not a Liberty from Holineſs, it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65165:238"/> is not a Liberty from cloſe application to the Redemption of Chriſt, and not to need it, on any pretence whatever; but it is a Liberty from any Impoſition that is Ceremonial, and does not by its Intrinſique Worth and Goodneſs, or by its Supreme Ordination from God, center in the true Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Mind, Conſcience, and whole Soul: yea, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God himſelf had Commanded the <hi>Jews,</hi> is not only reverſed, but deſpiſed for the ſake of Chriſtian Liberty, if it does not ſquare with it, ſo that no Yoak of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Bondage is laid upon us by God himſelf; that which <hi>had been,</hi> is taken away, and a Yoak of humane impoſiing is under the <hi>Goſpel-Anathema:</hi> the Doctrine of Godlineſs, of Redemption by Chriſt, may be juſtly meaſured by the true perfection of Conſcience. To do well in things intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically good, according to the Rule of Chriſtianity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly purg'd and atton'd by the Chriſtian Sacrifice, do alſo truly meaſure this Liberty: for on one ſide, <hi>the Kingdom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. He that in theſe things ſerves Chriſt, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men:</hi> It is not applying to <hi>the Blood of Bulls and Goats, that can never take away ſin,</hi> but <hi>to the Blood Offered by the Eternal Spirit, which certainly makes the comers thereunto perfect:</hi> On the other ſide, this Liberty lays not open the Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a Holy Life, nor removes the Barriers of Juſtice againſt Sin, if not ſatisfied and attoned by Faith in the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Laſtly, That which anſwers to each of theſe Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of True Religion, is, that is hath no Secular Intereſt, no Intereſt of this preſent World, <hi>that it looks not upon the things that are ſeen, that are but for a Moment, but on the things that are not ſeen, that are Eternal;</hi> ſuch is the Godlineſs, ſuch is the Sacrifice, ſuch the Chriſtian Liberty, that their Uſes and Ends are too great and large to center in Earthly things; and though themſelves are the True In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65165:238"/> of the preſent ſtate, yet they no way make it, or the Grandeur of it, an Intereſt, but ſeek a Heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and City; even as the Lord of this Religion ſaid, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World:</hi> Now as this meaſures each of the other Characters, ſo each of them meaſures it; ſuch a Tranſcendant Holineſs and Purity can alone ſee God in Eternal Habitations; ſuch a Sacrifice alone can have its Blood enter into the Holy Place made without Hands, having obtained an Eternal Inheritance; ſuch a Blood ſpeaks alone in the Heavens, <hi>better things than the Blood of Abel;</hi> a Conſcience ſo free, ſo perfected, hath boldneſs to enter into the Holieſt, and none elſe: Theſe are all fitted and Conſecrated to Eternity, and Eternity to them; Light and trivial Holineſs, Inſignificant Ceremonies, and Rites of Purgation; a cumber of External Obſervations, invented by Men, can never enter within the Vail, nor endure for ever. And on the other ſide, by ſuch Divine Things to graſp at this World, and a Patrimony on Earth, is as groſs and out of Square; ſo that theſe things exactly meaſure one another, and ſquare together.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>How is the Four-Square City, or the True Church, adjuſted to theſe Dimenſions?</hi>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65165:239"/> only an endleſs Variation from, but a flat Oppoſition to them, and a deſpiting them with themſelves, ſo ſtrangely, ſo monſtrouſly mis-ſhapen, and that in ſo great numbers, that as in mockage to the many excellent things our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our did and taught, ſo many, that if they were all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the World it ſelf could not contain the Books that would be written; even ſo, if all the numerous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious excurſions of the Antichriſtian Church, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt the Head of it, from Chriſtian Religion, by its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinable ſwarm of New pieces of Antichriſtianiſm, ſhould be written, the whole World it ſelf would not be able to contain the Volumes that would be written.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But does not the Profeſſion of ſo much of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in ſuch an Eminence, like tbe City upon the Hill that cannot be hid, give it the Reputation of a moſt Famous Church, if not the Catholick, as it calls it ſelf?</hi>

                     <p>Laſtly, It hath its effect upon them that may be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and receive Truth; but not the chaſte unproſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Love of Truth alone.</p>

                        <hi>CAP. XIV.</hi> Of the Power of Magiſtrates in Religion, and of National Religion.</head>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>IT is I think very clear, by all that hath been ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that the ſettlement of Religion in the Word of God, is moſt ſtable and certain, and that by no Powers he hath given in his Church, it can be changed, nor receive any Arbitrary Additions, that ſhould be Obligatory: But I am in great doubt, how to reconcile thoſe Commands of Scripture, <hi>to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers,</hi> with thoſe ſtrict Precepts, to keep cloſe to the Word of God, and <hi>to turn neither to the Right hand nor to the Left,</hi> where Rulers ſo often preſcribe in Religion, contrary to, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Word of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I aknowledge, the Reſolution of this Doubt contains many difficulties in it, and cannot be given at once, but I ſhall endeavour ſo to lead your Queſtions, by every Degree of Anſwer, as may direct into the beſt method for your ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>What, I pray you, is the firſt ſtep neceſſary to be taken in order to the Reſolving this Doubt?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To ſettle a True Underſtanding, how the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Power and Authority in Religion made entrance into the World.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>I very much deſire to know that, and believe it to be of very great Influence into all things that concern the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folding this Queſtion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This then I take to be the beſt Account of it; After the apparent Degeneracy of Humane Nature, ſo
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65165:241"/> that the Laws written in Mens Hearts, were evidently defaced and blotted by contrary Practices, there was a neceſſity of forming the great Notions of Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Godlineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Soberneſs, into Laws, that Men might be thereby preſerved from higheſt Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, and exceſs, under the pretence of being at Liberty, or every Man being a Lawgiver to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>I deſire you further to Explain how this brought in Magiſtracy?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That ſuch Laws might be made and Executed, there muſt be ſome ſupreme Legiſlative and Executive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in every Community; whether placed in one, or more; whether by the Title of Paternity or Primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; whether Hereditary and Succeſſive, or Elective; whether by Agreement and Covenant primarily, or by Submiſſion and Pacts after Conqueſt: Theſe things a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But the Laws of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Righteouſneſs and Soberneſs, are ſo neceſſary, and Men know them to be ſo neceſſary, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without them, nor without ſome Supreme Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation and Execution of Laws formed according to them: They that are above, ſee a neceſſity of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by them; they that are below, ſee a nceceſſity of being Governed by the ſame; and therefore ſubmit by Common Conſent to ſome ſupreme Authority, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordinate Magiſtrates under the Supreme, to that end. Mankind is touch'd by this Impreſſion from God, and all that are not, are branded as Sons of <hi>Belial.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But why hath it not pleaſed God, to appear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this Authority and Power, Viſibly, and Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which would cut off all Diſpute, as to Supreme Right, and Male-Adminiſtration; which do now often diſturb the Peace of Government, and the People under it; or at leaſt why hath he not given Angels a Superiority, and Viſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency over Kingdoms, as that which would much more awe, and Compoſe the World?</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Wiſdom of God hath in all things appeared, in attempering things one to another with greateſt Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>But I deſire you to give yet a cloſer and ſtricter Account of the Power of Soveraigns in Religion, or Godlineſs, being the main point of of the preſent Enquiry?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> That I may anſwer your deſire, I muſt conſider Religion as it is Natural Religion, written in the Hearts of Men; as it is Revealed Religion, publiſhed by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Miniſters, and Conſign'd to after Ages by inſpired Writing, or Scripture; and laſtly, as Religion is ſo or ſo Circumſtantiated and Modelled in the External Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it.</p>
                     <p>Now by Natural Religion, as diſtinguiſh'd from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, I do plainly intend, that Religion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be drawn out by the meer force of Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65165:243"/> without any plain or known Aſſiſtances of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Truth; or whether it was not known to be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion till being Revealed, Natural Conſcience acknowledges it, and muſt needs Confeſs it to be True Natural Religion; or that the wiſeſt and ſobereſt part of Mankind confeſſes it to be ſo; or whether it be what Natural Religion teaches, upon the ſuppoſition of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion, acknowledged, and confeſſed to be from God; for then Natural Religion confeſſes, and urges, that all Revelations from God, that evidence themſelves to any Mans mind to be from God, ſhould be received with Reverence, and ſubmitted to with Obedience: In all theſe caſes of Natural Religion, I boldly and poſitively aſſert, the Soveraign Power hath a Right given it by God, to Make, and Execute Laws according to the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Natural Religion, even as in all Caſes of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Soberneſs, or Common Peace and Welfare, and to puniſh Offenders, and Tranſgreſſors according to the Degree of their Guilt, and can no more be Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that procedure, than in any the moſt undoubted Functions, or Rights of Government whatever.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>I muſt deſire to be guided in my Thoughts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Power of Governours in Revealed Religion?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Beſides the Legiſlative and Vindictive Power of Supreme Magiſtrates in Natural Religion; there is that Divine ſtamp of Authority, God hath Engraven upon them, ſo that beſides their Laws, they recommend Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the very repreſentation of God himſelf, whoſe Preſence they bear, and have not only the more Remote Authority of a Prince, but the neareſt, moſt Natural, and kindly Authority of a Father. On account of which <hi>Solomon,</hi> as a King, ſo often ſpeaks, <hi>Hear, O ye Children, the Inſtruction of a Father,</hi> and (as having all Parental Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in himſelf,) <hi>forſake not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Law of a Mother.</hi> The Care of all means for Inſtruction, and Propagation
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65165:243"/> of Religion, is moſt proper to Government: And all theſe Adminiſtrations in Religion, run not only through all points of Natural Religion, in that ampleneſs before expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but do moſt genuinely and freely ſtream through all points of Revealed Truth, and the whole Counſel of God in the Scripture, nothing being more Princely and Paternal, than the utmoſt Providence, and Influence of Princes, and Soveraign States herein, wherein they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Propheſie, of <hi>Kings being Nurſing Fathers, and Queens Nurſing Mothers</hi> to the Church of God.</p>
                     <p>But there is this difference between Natural and Revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Religion; Natural Religion is written in the Heart, and may certainly be found there, (however it comes to be known, clearly, and truly, only by Revelation) and ſo may be abſolutely Commanded: But Revealed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is recorded by <hi>Faith, and Faith cometh by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God,</hi> and therefore cannot be Commanded, but muſt be expected by the Bleſſing of God upon Inſtruction: But if any Man profeſs to believe Revealed Religion, to have received it as the undoubted Truth of God, it is then the Law of Nature, he ſhould deport himſelf in it, and towards it, as to the Truth of God: <hi>Nebuchadnezzer, Darius,</hi> and the <hi>King of Nineveh,</hi> their Laws were rightly grounded upon the Principles of Natural Religion concerning the True God: The Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> in Revealed Religion, were upon the ſo unavoidable acknowledgement of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſence and Authority in and with thoſe Laws, the ſo many Repeated Covenants, Indentures, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that People, on the evident Appearances of God, to be obedient to thoſe Laws.

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>Before you paſs from this point, that it may be made the clearer; will you give the Diſtinction between So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Powers, and the Elders of the Church? For they are both called <hi>Rulers,</hi> they are both called the <hi>Miniſters of God?</hi>
                        </hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is indeed moſt neceſſary to be known, as tending much to Illuſtrate this whole Matter.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Power of the Elders of the Church lies wholly and intirely in the Evidence of the Truth, and the Word of God they Miniſter, without which their Perſons are Inveſted with no Power, or Authority at all. But there is a Sacred Character upon Soveraign Powers, and their very Perſons, ſo that Reverence, Proſtration, Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, Honourable Titles, and Obedience in all Lawful Things are due to them, even when their Commands, in ſome things being unlawful, cannot be obeyed, as appears every where in Scripture.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Authority, Power, and Majeſty of Sovereign Princes remains Inviolable, and not to be invaded by any, no not by thoſe who have Commiſſion to ſpeak the Word of God: There is no Temporal Power in order to Spirituals Conferred by Chriſt, or Ordained to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to Create a Civil-Spiritual Power within a Civil, and to rencounter it: But Princes are in all Cauſes, and over all Perſons, within their own Dominions, under God, and according to his appointment, Supream Governours; ſo contrary is Scripture to the Uſurpation of the Anti-Church herein: All Religious Princes guiding themſelves by Gods Word, have great Power and Authority, not only by that Word, but by Virtue of that Authority and Majeſty God hath Cloathed them with, as his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents, to Direct and Govern according to Truth;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65165:244"/> wherein the Divine Spirit is pleaſed often to be ſo imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preſent with them, that <hi>a Divine Sentence is in the Kings Lips,</hi> that they may direct according to Truth; and in all Truth they are to be Obey'd, not only for the Truths ſake, but for that Authorities ſake alſo God hath Inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Elders of the Church loſe their Power by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from Truth and the Word of God; for of what Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is the Falſe Prophet, or the Falſe Teacher? But Princes and Soveraign Powers have a Power, though miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apply'd, to vindicate their Authority upon thoſe that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Obey them; except they ſhould Diſobey God to Obey Magiſtrates, which none dare aſſert that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God; in which Power Magiſtrates muſt not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, even while they cauſe Men <hi>to ſuffer for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Admonitions, Excommunications, Anathema's of Church Rulers, have no Force, when not grounded upon Divine Truth, nor ought to make Impreſſion upon Conſcience, but to be rejected with Diſdain: But the Penal Sentences, and Vindictive Decrees of Sovereign Powers have their Effect ſo far, even when they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, as to be received as an Ordination of Power ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, though us'd to a wrong purpoſe: <hi>Where the Word of a King is, there is Power, and his Wrath is as the Roaring of a Lion,</hi> and it is ſo appointed by God: Againſt ſuch a Supream Executive Power, Arm'd with the Supream Legiſlative Power of a Nation, there is no riſing up, no remedy, but appeal to God by Prayers and Tears.</p>
                     <p>Queſt. <hi>This whole Account might be much Illuſtrated if it be declared on the other ſide, what Obedience is due to the Miniſters of the Word, and Truth of God; whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, as Prophets and Apoſtles; or ordinary, as the

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> National Religion, ſeeing it is deſign'd to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend a multitude of Perſons of moſt neceſſarily, and unavoidably various Sentiments and Apprehenſions, muſt be ſo prepared, as that with greateſt Eaſe and Room to Conſciences and Underſtandings, of ſo many ſeveral Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Impreſſions, there may be an Union in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Religion with leaſt Scruple, and therefore to give all the Liberty, that Truth gives, not impoſing Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, becauſe Religion as hath been ſaid, is Gods Peculiar, and in that, the Doubting Conſcience cannot Obey far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than it ſees the Divine Rule before it, not in things Dark and Diſputable, becauſe clear things are only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, not forcibly, except when Natural Religion is Violated, becauſe patient Inſtruction, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and Ratiocination are the Divine Methods in giving and working Faith.</p>

                     <p>Queſt. <hi>I now expect the laſt Propoſition?</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſhall give you the laſt, and therein Conclude this whole Enquiry, and Inſtruction, and it is this,</p>
                     <p>The True Religion of the Word of God in a Nation, or City, does overtop all the Falſe and Private Religions in it, and become in the Sacred Regiſter, the National Religion. In the Sacred Maps, the Chriſtians of <hi>Achaia,</hi> were <hi>Achaia</hi> it ſelf: The <hi>Seven Churches of</hi> Aſia, were the Cities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And whatever Leſſer Differences, or Diviſions, this or that Name of Diſtinction may ſeem to make in National Religion, yet, the True Subſtantial Religion in all of them ſhall be one National Religion; and become one <hi>Rod</hi> and <hi>Scepter</hi> in the Hand of Chriſt, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be as one National Tribe, and Church: For let Men do what they can againſt it, True Religion, as it is the only Publick Religion, and no Separation of Men from it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever called Publick, can make it Private; ſo in what place ſoever it is, it ſhall have the moſt Publick Character, and the True Religion in all thoſe that ſincerely profeſs it, ſhall be one True Publick Religion, and thoſe little Differences ſhall not cleave it into more than one. Without the Change of True Religion it ſelf, there cannot be a Schiſm of a deeper Senſe in it; if Bitterneſs and Animoſity, Cenſoriouſneſs, and the Perſecuting Spirit were away: God will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly Interpret Scruples on one ſide to a Jealouſie for the Purity of Religion, the freedom of the other to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to Propagate it under the favour of Laws, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be capable of doing moſt Good. In Heaven they now are all one, and ſhall be one, and the Envy, Strife, and Contention (which the Good Lord Pardon) ſhall be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Aboliſhed. This is the Honour of True Religion, of Publick Divine Religion.</p>
